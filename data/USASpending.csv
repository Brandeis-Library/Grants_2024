SIGNALING MOLECULES EXPRESSED ON THE NEURONAL CELL SURFACE DURING EARLY DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCT SYNAPSE FORMATION AND SPECIFY THE IDENTITY OF SYNAPSES AS EXCITATORY OR INHIBITORY. PROPER BALANCE BETWEEN EXCITATION AND INHIBITION IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROPER NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTION.

DESPITE A ROBUST UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF EXCITATORY SYNAPSE FORMATION, RELATIVELY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT INHIBITORY SYNAPSE FORMATION. PREVIOUS WORK INDICATES THAT THE CLEAVED TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN SEMAPHORIN 4D (SEMA4D), SIGNALING VIA ITS RECEPTOR PLEXINB1, RAPIDLY (~30 MINS) PROMOTES THE FORMATION OF NEW INHIBITORY SYNAPSES IN THE ADULT BRAIN. IN ADDITION, SEMA4D EXCLUSIVELY PROMOTES INHIBITORY SYNAPSE FORMATION WHILE HAVING NO EFFECT ON EXCITATORY SYNAPSES, A PROPERTY WHICH THUS FAR APPEARS TO BE UNIQUE TO SEMA4D. FURTHER, PREVIOUS WORK SHOWED THAT TREATMENT WITH SEMA4D INCREASES SEIZURE RESISTANCE IN ADULT MICE IN VIVO, SUGGESTING THAT SELECTIVELY INCREASING INHIBITORY SYNAPSE DENSITY MAY HAVE THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS.  THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO ELUCIDATE THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH NEW INHIBITORY SYNAPSES ARE FORMED IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM BY UTILIZING THE UNIQUE ABILITY OF SEMA4D TO RAPIDLY PROMOTE INHIBITORY SYNAPSE FORMATION.

ALTHOUGH RECENTLY THERE HAS BEEN EMPHASIS ON STUDYING MORE DIVERSE AND REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES IN COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE, LITTLE RESEARCH HAS APPLIED A CULTURAL APPROACH TO STUDY MEMORY STRATEGIES. CULTURE CAN SHAPE THE WAY ONE THINKS ABOUT THE SELF, KNOWN AS SELF-CONSTRUAL, WHICH CAN HAVE MAJOR IMPLICATIONS FOR COGNITION. THINKING ABOUT THE SELF CAN ENHANCE MEMORY VIA THE SELF-REFERENCE EFFECT, A STRATEGY THAT RELIES ON RELATING INFORMATION TO ONESELF. CONTEXT FEATURES OF TO-BE-ENCODED EVENTS THAT CAN BE USED TO ENHANCE EPISODIC MEMORY MAY BE ATTENDED TO DIFFERENTLY ACROSS CULTURES, POTENTIALLY AFFECTING EPISODIC MEMORY. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH CULTURE IMPACTS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE MEMORY STRATEGIES HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED. WE ADDRESS THIS GAP IN THE LITERATURE BY INVESTIGATING MULTIPLE CULTURAL GROUPS IN THE U.S. THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE PROJECT ARE TO ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SELF-REFERENCING AND CONTEXT IMPACT MEMORY, AS WELL AS THE NEURAL ACTIVITY THAT SUPPORTS THESE BENEFITS IN MEMORY, IN CULTURALLY DIVERSE SAMPLES. AN INDEPENDENT SELF, CONSIDERED SEPARATE FROM AND UNIQUE FROM OTHERS, CHARACTERIZES NON-HISPANIC WHITE SAMPLES WHEREAS CHINESE AND LATINO SAMPLES TEND TO BE MORE INTERDEPENDENT, CONCEPTUALIZING THE SELF IN TERMS OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS. WE WILL TEST TO WHAT EXTENT CULTURAL GROUP AND ASSOCIATED FACTORS IMPACT SELF-REFERENCE AND CONTEXT EFFECTS IN EPISODIC MEMORY IN NON-HISPANIC WHITES, 2ND GENERATION CHINESE AMERICANS, AND 2ND GENERATION MEXICAN AMERICANS, THE TWO LARGEST RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS IN THE U.S; THEREBY MOVING BEYOND THE EAST- WEST COMPARISONS TYPICAL OF CULTURE WORK. ALTHOUGH THESE 2ND GENERATION GROUPS HAVE MANY ASPECTS OF SELF- CONSTRUAL IN COMMON, THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES, SUCH AS EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIVITY. WE WILL EXPLORE CULTURE GROUP DIFFERENCES IN THE CONTENT OF EPISODIC MEMORIES, AND THE POTENTIAL HETEROGENEITY OF 2ND GENERATION SAMPLES BY CONSIDERING THE ROLES OF CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE IDENTITY, AND STRESS ON MEMORY OUTCOMES. WE WILL MEASURE BEHAVIORAL MEMORY PERFORMANCE AND BRAIN ACTIVITY DURING EPISODIC ENCODING AND RETRIEVAL (ERP AND ENCODING- RETRIEVAL SIMILARITY ANALYSES) TO DISTINGUISH MECHANISMS OF STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION FROM PROCESSES SPECIFIC TO MEMORY SUCCESS, ALLOWING US TO UNDERSTAND HOW CULTURE IMPACTS EPISODIC MEMORY. NOT ONLY WILL THE PROJECT DIVERSIFY AND EXPAND OUR STUDY POPULATIONS BUT SHOULD THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE MEMORY STRATEGIES DEPEND UPON CULTURE, IT WOULD SUGGEST A NEED TO UPDATE AND ADVANCE CURRENT MEMORY THEORIES TO INCORPORATE THE INFLUENCE OF THESE FACTORS.

THEREFORE, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO PRIORITIZE SAFETY AS A FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT ACROSS VARIOUS DOMAINS OF AI RESEARCH. NOTABLY, DUE TO THE UBIQUITY OF NETWORK (GRAPH) DATA, NETWORK LEARNING TECHNIQUES HAVE STRONGLY IMPACTED AI IN THE PAST DECADE, BEING WIDELY DEPLOYED ACROSS APPLICATIONS SUCH AS SOCIAL NETWORKS, HEALTHCARE, AND CYBERSECURITY. HOWEVER, REAL-WORLD NETWORKS OFTEN INCLUDE CHALLENGES LIKE DATA ISSUES AND UNFORESEEN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS, RESULTING IN RISKY AI TECHNIQUES AND UNSAFE OUTCOMES WHEN THESE NETWORKS ARE EMPLOYED. EXISTING STUDIES FOR SAFE NETWORK LEARNING LACK VERSATILITY, EFFICIENCY, AND COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATION ACROSS MULTIPLE SAFETY DIMENSIONS. THEY STRUGGLE TO ENSURE TIMELY, SAFE PREDICTIONS IN PRACTICAL SCENARIOS AND FAIL TO HOLISTICALLY ADDRESS DATA, MODEL, AND USAGE ASPECTS. THESE CHALLENGES COLLECTIVELY HINDER THEIR CAPABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS, AND THERE IS CURRENTLY A LACK OF A HOLISTIC FRAMEWORK TO ADEQUATELY TACKLE SAFETY ISSUES IN NETWORK LEARNING. TO BRIDGE THIS RESEARCH GAP, THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DESIGN, DEVELOP, AND EVALUATE A NOVEL SAFETY-CENTRIC NETWORK LEARNING FRAMEWORK (SNL) FOR SAFE DECISION-MAKING ON NETWORKS IN THE WILD. THE PROJECT OUTCOMES WILL SUBSTANTIALLY IMPACT NETWORK LEARNING RESEARCH AND OFFER ADVANCED SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES ACROSS DIVERSE DOMAINS SUCH AS PUBLIC HEALTH, CYBERSECURITY, AND SOCIAL MEDIA. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROJECT WILL FOSTER INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATIONS AND FACILITATE TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO INDUSTRY. THE PROJECT OUTCOMES WILL BE MADE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE AND BROADLY DISSEMINATED. MOREOVER, THE PROJECT WILL INTEGRATE RESEARCH WITH EDUCATION THROUGH NOVEL CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND STUDENT MENTORING ACTIVITIES WITH AN EMPHASIS ON UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS, AIMING TO TRAIN AND EDUCATE FUTURE GENERATIONS IN EFFECTIVELY DEVELOPING AND UTILIZING AI WHILE ALSO ENSURING AI SAFETY. THE PROJECT WILL INVOLVE COMPREHENSIVE EFFORTS TO DEVELOP SNL THAT PRIORITIZES THE CRITICAL SAFETY DIMENSIONS OF RELIABILITY, STABILITY, AND EXPLAINABILITY, AND FURTHER ENCOMPASSES THE CRUCIAL ASPECTS OF DATA, MODEL, AND USAGE IN A GENERAL, EFFICIENT, AND INTEGRATED MANNER. FORMALLY, SNL WILL PROVIDE RELIABLE NETWORK DATA AND NETWORK LEARNING MODELS (RELIABILITY) WHILE GENERATING STABLE AND CONSISTENT OUTPUTS (STABILITY) ACCOMPANIED BY EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE USAGE EXPLANATIONS (EXPLAINABILITY). SPECIFICALLY, THE RESEARCH COMPONENTS THAT ENGAGE INNOVATIVE THEORIES, ALGORITHMS, AND MODELS IN THIS PROJECT ARE FOURFOLD. FIRST, DESIGN NOVEL NETWORK LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO IDENTIFY AND GENERATE RELIABLE NETWORK DATA THAT ARE MINIMALLY IMPACTED BY DATA AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. SECOND, CREATE NEW NETWORK REPRESENTATION LEARNING MODELS AND TRAINING STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE EFFICIENCY AND RELIABILITY IN LEARNING NETWORK REPRESENTATIONS. THIRD, DEVISE INNOVATIVE DATA-TO-MODEL OPTIMIZATION THEORIES TO ENSURE THE STABILITY OF NETWORK LEARNING. FINALLY, DEVELOP NOVEL GENERATIVE LEARNING METHODS TO ADVANCE THE USAGE EXPLAINABILITY AND OUTPUT RECEPTIVITY OF NETWORK LEARNING. THE UNIFIED FRAMEWORK ALLOWS SEAMLESS COLLABORATION AND MUTUAL REINFORCEMENT AMONG DIFFERENT RESEARCH COMPONENTS.

THE ER IS A CONTIGUOUS MEMBRANE-BOUND COMPARTMENT, WHICH FORMS A NETWORK OF TUBULES THAT EXTENDS TO THE PERIPHERY OF NEURONS AND FORMS CONTACTS WITH OTHER ORGANELLES, CONTROLLING PROCESSES SUCH AS LIPID TRANSFER, ORGANELLE SCISSION, AND CALCIUM SIGNALING. PATIENTS WITH NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS, SUCH AS HEREDITARY SPASTIC PARAPLEGIA (HSP), OFTEN HAVE MUTATIONS IN GENES THAT DISRUPT ER STRUCTURE AND ER CONTACTS. HOWEVER, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ER FUNCTION IN NEURONS PRIMARILY COMES FROM STUDIES OF NON-NEURONAL CELLS. THE COMPLEX MORPHOLOGIES AND ELONGATED STRUCTURES OF NEURONS IMPOSE UNIQUE CHALLENGES FOR SECRETORY AND ENDOSOMAL MEMBRANE TRAFFICKING PATHWAYS. IN PARTICULAR, ENDOSOMES ARE VITAL FOR CONVEYING LONG-DISTANCE SIGNALS WITHIN NEURONS AND PACKAGING CARGOES FOR INTERCELLULAR SIGNALING THROUGH EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES. WE CURRENTLY KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT HOW ER CONTACTS REGULATE NEURONAL ENDOSOMAL COMPARTMENTS, OR HOW THE STRUCTURE OF THE NEURONAL ER IS MODIFIED BY ACTIVITY. THIS PROJECT WILL USE DROSOPHILA AND MAMMALIAN NEURONAL SYSTEMS TO EXAMINE ER-ENDOSOME CONTACTS IN NEURONS AND TO STUDY HOW NEURONAL ACTIVITY REGULATES THE ER. THE DROSOPHILA NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION IS AN EXCELLENT SYSTEM TO STUDY THE ER BECAUSE IT IS GENETICALLY TRACTABLE, AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE FOR LIVE IMAGING AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY. ON THE OTHER HAND, MAMMALIAN NEURONAL CULTURES PROVIDE HOMOGENEOUS MATERIAL FOR BIOCHEMICAL STUDIES, AND CAN SHOW IF FINDINGS IN DROSOPHILA ARE EVOLUTIONARILY CONSERVED. FIRST, THIS PROPOSAL WILL DETERMINE HOW THE HSP-LINKED GENE ATLASTIN, WHICH CONTROLS THE ASSEMBLY OF THE ER INTO A RETICULAR NETWORK, AFFECTS ER-ENDOSOME CONTACTS IN DROSOPHILA AND MAMMALIAN NEURONS (AIM1A,C). ATLASTIN MUTANT SYNAPSES WILL BE EXAMINED TO UNCOVER THE MECHANISTIC BASIS OF THE OBSERVED STRUCTURAL AND DYNAMIC DEFECTS IN THE ER, AS WELL AS THE ACCUMULATION OF ENDOSOMAL AND EXTRACELLULAR VESICLE CARGOES (AIM1B). NEXT, THIS STUDY WILL EXAMINE HOW DIFFERENT NEURONAL ACTIVITY PARADIGMS (E.G. SPONTANEOUS VS. MILD VS STRONG STIMULATION) REGULATE THE DYNAMICS OF THE ER AND ER-ENDOSOME CONTACTS IN DROSOPHILA (AIM2A). FINALLY, PROXIMITY LABELING APPROACHES WILL ALSO BE USED IN HIPPOCAMPAL NEURONS TO IDENTIFY CANDIDATE PROTEINS AT ER CONTACTS THAT ARE REGULATED BY NEURONAL ACTIVITY, TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE FUNCTIONAL STUDIES IN DROSOPHILA (AIM2B). TO ACHIEVE THESE RESEARCH GOALS, THE PROPOSED TRAINING PLAN WILL EXPAND THE PI’S EXPERIMENTAL SKILLSETS IN VARIOUS MICROSCOPY TECHNIQUES, CONSTRUCTION OF GENETIC SENSORS, MAMMALIAN NEURONAL CULTURE, AND NEW CODING SKILLS FOR IMAGE ANALYSIS SUCH AS IMAGE RESTORATION AND PARTICLE TRACKING. THE CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOCUSES ON STRENGTHENING THE PI'S PUBLICATION RECORD, TRANSITIONING TO AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH POSITION, AND PROMOTING DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION IN SCIENCE.

MANY OF THESE MOLECULES ARE CHALLENGING TO ISOLATE FROM NATURAL SOURCES, RESULTING IN LIMITED QUANTITIES BEING AVAILABLE TO STUDY. SPECIFICALLY, THIS WORK WILL COUPLE ORGANIC SYNTHESIS WITH ENZYMOLOGY (BIOCATALYSIS) TO PREPARE ALKALOIDS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FOR THEIR FURTHER STUDY, PARTICULARLY THEIR STUDY FOR THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES. THE BIOCATALYSIS THAT THE TING GROUP IS EXAMINING MODIFIES RELATIVELY COMPLEX MOLECULAR INTERMEDIATES AND BY DOING SO, ALLOWS THEM TO DIRECTLY ACCESS THE ALKALOIDS. IN ADDITION TO THE RESEARCH PLAN, OUTREACH ACTIVITIES ARE PLANNED TO INTRODUCE ORGANIC CHEMISTRY TO MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS IN WALTHAM, MASSACHUSETTS.

THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THESE ACTIVITIES IS TO ENGAGE STUDENTS EARLY ON IN CHEMISTRY AND ESPECIALLY ORGANIC CHEMISTRY IN SO DOING, INITIATE INTEREST IN PURSUING SCIENCE PROFESSIONALLY. THE TING LAB IS ENABLING THE TOTAL SYNTHESIS OF COMPLEX, POLYCYCLIC ALKALOIDS BY INCORPORATING ENZYME-CATALYZED REACTIONS AT A LATE STAGE INTO THEIR TOTAL SYNTHESIS EFFORTS. THEIR APPROACH IS NOT ONLY CONCEPTUALLY DIFFERENT THAN TRADITIONAL TOTAL SYNTHESIS EFFORTS BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF BIOCATALYSIS IN THE SYNTHETIC DESIGN. THE APPROACH ALSO DIFFERS FROM MOST CHEMOENZYMATIC SYNTHETIC METHODS IN THAT THESE TYPICALLY INVOLVE THE BIOCATALYST-FACILITATED SYNTHESIS OF EARLIER STAGE SYNTHETIC BUILDING BLOCKS, OFTEN WITH CONTROL OF ABSOLUTE STEREOCHEMISTRY.

SNAP HAS BEEN FOUND TO ALLEVIATE FOOD INSECURITY (ALBEIT NOT FULLY), AND IS DISPROPORTIONATELY UTILIZED BY RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, WHO HAVE GREATER SENSITIVITIES TO FOOD INSECURITY (GIVEN “THINNER MARGINS OF HEALTH” STEMMING FROM EXPOSURES TO OTHER INEQUITIES). SNAP POLICY CHANGES COULD THEREFORE AFFECT HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES FOR RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS THAN FOR THEIR COUNTERPARTS. FURTHER, THESE GROUPS EXPERIENCE HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES (E.G., IN DISEASE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT, UNFAVORABLE CLINICAL EVENTS, AND EXPENDITURES) THAT ARE LIKELY AFFECTED BY FOOD INSECURITY: INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO FOOD INSECURITY MISS NEEDED CARE AND MEDICATIONS, USE EMERGENCY AND INPATIENT CARE, AND REQUIRE EXPENDITURES ALL AT HIGHER RATES THAN UNEXPOSED INDIVIDUALS, AND EFFECTS ARE ELEVATED AMONG PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS.  WE WILL USE BOTH NATIONAL MEDICAID DATA AND A NOVEL SET OF LINKED CLAIMS, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND ADMINISTRATIVE SNAP DATA FROM MASSACHUSETTS TO EXPLOIT A STAGGERED SET OF NATURAL EXPERIMENTS CREATED BY THE FAMILIES FIRST CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE ACT: (I) APRIL 2020: ~60% OF SNAP HOUSEHOLDS WERE GIVEN VARIABLE AMOUNTS OF ADDED MONTHLY BENEFITS (UP TO OVER $1,000/MONTH, WITH AN AVERAGE OF $161/UNIT/MONTH OVER THE FIRST YEAR), (II) MAY 2021: THOSE WITH NO/SMALL BOOSTS WERE GIVEN UP TO $95/MONTH IN ADDED BENEFITS, AND (III) SINCE APRIL 2021: 18 STATES HAVE ENDED THE NEW BENEFITS, WHICH WILL END FOR REMAINING STATES IN MARCH 2023. IN MA, SNAP-LINKED DATA WILL ALLOW US TO USE THESE CHANGES TO MODEL DOSE-RESPONSES AND TREATMENT REMOVAL PRECISELY. T-MSIS MEDICAID DATA AND STATE VARIABILITY WILL BROADEN INSIGHTS AND IMPROVE THE GENERALIZABILITY OF OUR FINDINGS.  AS THESE SNAP CHANGES OCCURRED, MULTIPLE CONTEMPORANEOUS DISRUPTIONS TO HEALTHCARE, PUBLIC HEALTH, SOCIAL WELFARE POLICIES, AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WERE OCCURRING AS WELL. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, WE WILL LEVERAGE THE SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY IN THE GEOGRAPHY AND TIMING OF THE DISRUPTIONS, IN ADDITION TO THE ROBUST EFFORTS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE DURING THE PANDEMIC TO PROVIDE DETAILED, PUBLICALLY AVAILABLE DATA ON THESE DISRUPTIONS. WE WILL USE CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS, MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES, AND AN EXPERT PANEL TO GUIDE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF AND ADJUSTMENT FOR THESE FACTORS (AIM 1). WE WILL THEN USE GROWTH CURVE MODELS TO MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF EACH SNAP CHANGE ON HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES (I.E., PREVENTIVE USE, UNFAVORABLE EVENTS, AND EXPENDITURES) (AIM 2) AND ON HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES BASED ON RACE/ETHNICITY AND DISABILITY STATUS (AIM 3) IN MA AND THE US. CHANGES TO SNAP’S FUNDING AND ADMINISTRATION ARE ROUTINELY DEBATED.

REPRODUCING THESE LIFE-LIKE BEHAVIORS IN SYNTHETIC MATERIALS WOULD BOTH REVOLUTIONIZE ENGINEERING AND ADVANCE FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE. ACTIVE FLUIDS, WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF MOTILE ENERGY-CONSUMING MICROSCOPIC UNITS, ARE A PROMISING PLATFORM FOR ACHIEVING THESE AMBITIOUS GOALS. IN CONTRAST TO WIDELY STUDIED CONVENTIONAL PASSIVE MATERIALS, ACTIVE FLUIDS GENERATE INTERNAL FORCES THAT DRIVE PERSISTENT AUTONOMOUS MOTION, AN ALLURING LIFE-LIKE FEATURE. ON THEIR OWN, HOWEVER, BULK ACTIVE FLUIDS EXHIBIT CHAOTIC FLOWS. THUS, THEY ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM USEFUL FUNCTIONS SUCH AS GENERATING WORK OR DRIVING NET MATERIAL TRANSPORT. BY SEAMLESSLY MERGING EXPERIMENTS, THEORY AND MACHINE LEARNING METHODS, THIS PROJECT AIMS TO HARNESS THE CHAOTIC DYNAMICS OF ACTIVE FLUIDS TO ACHIEVE FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIORS. IN PARTICULAR, THE PROJECT WILL MEASURE THE INSTANTANEOUS CONFIGURATION OF A LIGHT-RESPONSIVE ACTIVE FLUID AND USE MODEL-DEPENDENT THEORY AND/OR MODEL-INDEPENDENT MACHINE-LEARNING METHODS TO FORECAST ITS EVOLVING DYNAMICS.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: BY CONTROLLING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE FORCE-GENERATING CYTOSKELETON AND THE SURROUNDING DEFORMABLE LIPID MEMBRANE, BIOLOGICAL CELLS ACHIEVE REMARKABLE FUNCTIONALITIES. INSPIRED BY THIS OBSERVATION, THIS PROJECT WILL PURSUE TWO COMPLEMENTARY AIMS THAT USE LIGHT-RESPONSIVE MICROTUBULE-BASED ACTIVE FLUIDS TO CONTROL THE DYNAMICS AND MOTIONS OF RIGID AND DEFORMABLE INTERFACES AND INCLUSIONS. THIS REPRESENTS A FIRST STEP TOWARD CREATING SYNTHETIC LIFE-LIKE MATERIALS AND MACHINES. THE FIRST AIM WILL EMBED AN ISOLATED RIGID INCLUSION INTO A PHOTO-RESPONSIVE ACTIVE NEMATIC LIQUID CRYSTAL. THE STRESSES GENERATED BY THE ACTIVE FLUID EXERT STOCHASTIC FORCES ON THE INCLUSION, DRIVING ITS DYNAMICS. THE AIM IS TO IMPLEMENT HYBRID THEORY-EXPERIMENT FEEDBACK TO DRIVE THE TARGETED INCLUSION DYNAMICS BY IMPOSING SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS OF ACTIVE STRESS. THE SECOND AIM WILL ENCAPSULATE LIGHT-RESPONSIVE ACTIVE FLUIDS WITHIN DEFORMABLE DROPLETS CREATED BY CONVENTIONAL LIQUID-LIQUID PHASE SEPARATION. UNDER UNIFORM ILLUMINATION (THUS UNIFORM ACTIVITY), ACTIVE DROPLETS EXHIBIT LIFE-LIKE MORPHOLOGICAL SHAPE CHANGES AND ACTIVITY-INDUCED SPREADING, BUT UNLIKE BIOLOGICAL CELLS HAVE NO DIRECTIONAL MOTION. THE IMPLEMENTED FEEDBACK SCHEME WILL CONTROL THE FORMATION, MOTILITY, FUSION, AND BREAKUP OF THE ACTIVE DROPLETS. THE PROJECT WILL DEVELOP UNIQUE RESPONSIVE AND ADAPTIVE MATERIALS AS ENVISIONED BY THE DMREF PROGRAM, BY IMPLEMENTING ITERATIVE THEORY/EXPERIMENT FEEDBACK CYCLES DURING A SINGLE EXPERIMENT ON TIMESCALES OF SECONDS TO MINUTES.

MANY OF THE GRANULES IDENTIFIED TO DATE CONTAIN A MIXTURE OF NUCLEIC ACIDS AND PROTEINS. IN THE CYTOPLASM, OFTEN THE CONDENSATES ARE RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN (RNP) GRANULES. TWO OF THE BEST STUDIED OF THESE, THE STRESS GRANULE (SG) AND THE PROCESSING BODY (P-BODY) SEQUESTER RNAS AND ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE INHIBITION OF PROTEIN SYNTHESIS. IN CONTRAST TO THESE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED CYTOPLASMIC GRANULES THIS NEW BIOMOLECULAR CONDENSATE (5B GRANULE) IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE STIMULATION OF TRANSLATION OF SPECIFIC MRNAS. STRESS INDUCING AGENTS, SUCH AS SODIUM ARSENITE TREATMENT OR SORBITOL, STIMULATE THE FORMATION OF 5B GRANULES. INTERESTINGLY, THESE SAME TREATMENTS STIMULATE SG FORMATION AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF P-BODIES, SUGGESTING THAT UNDER STRESS CONDITIONS THE CELL CONTAINS BOTH REPRESSIVE AND STIMULATORY GRANULES. UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, AND IN CONTRAST TO STRESS GRANULES, THE 5B GRANULES STIMULATE IRES ACTIVITY AND REPRESENT A NEW CYTOPLASMIC CONDENSATE. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND AND START TO EXPLORE WHAT THESE GRANULES ARE WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT COMPONENTS ARE IN THE GRANULES AND HOW MUCH THESE GRANULES INFLUENCE GLOBAL TRANSLATION. TO THIS END WE ARE PROPOSING TWO SPECIFIC AIMS. AIM 1. IDENTIFY THE COMPONENTS OF THE 5B GRANULE AND DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER CYTOPLASMIC GRANULES. WE WILL USE AN UNBIASED APPROACH AND A CANDIDATE APPROACH TO IDENTIFY THE PROTEIN COMPONENTS OF THE 5B GRANULE. WE WILL USE QUANTITATIVE MASS SPECTROMETRY TO IDENTIFY PROTEINS IN PROXIMITY WITH EIF5B UNDER CONDITIONS THAT FAVOR 5B GRANULE FORMATION. WE WILL USE PROXIMITY LABELING AND PRECIPITATION TO ENRICH EIF5B ASSOCIATED PROTEINS. WE WILL ALSO TAKE A CANDIDATE APPROACH, USING MARKERS OF THE OTHER GRANULES AND CYTOPLASMIC RNA BINDING PROTEINS TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE STRESS GRANULE, THE P-BODY AND THE 5B GRANULE. AIM 2.

MEANWHILE, STATE-LEVEL VARIATION IN APPROACHES TO UNWINDING THE FFCRA SNAP INCREASES (E.G., TIMING RANGING FROM APRIL 2021 TO MARCH 2023), INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL VARIATION IN THE SIZE OF BENEFIT LOSSES (RANGING FROM $95 PER MONTH TO OVER $1,000 PER MONTH), AND A MASSACHUSETTS (MA) POLICY THAT BROKE THE STATE’S SNAP ROLLBACKS INTO TWO UNEVEN STEPS ALL CREATE NATURAL EXPERIMENTS WE CAN USE TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSAL IMPACTS OF SNAP.

SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL CREATE A REGISTRY OF POLICIES RELATED TO THE UNWINDING OF FOOD, HOUSING, AND MEDICAID ACCESS AND THEN DEVELOP PARSIMONIOUS SETS OF POLICY UNWINDING PATTERNS TO IDENTIFY ADJUSTERS FOR LATER ANALYSES (WE WILL SIMILARLY ATTEND TO OTHER HEALTHCARE, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS) (AIM 1). WE WILL THEN ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF SNAP UNWINDING ON MEDICAID EVENT RATES (PREVENTIVE USE, UNFAVORABLE EVENT RATES, AND EXPENDITURES; AIM 2), AND WE WILL FINALLY ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF SNAP UNWINDING ON DISPARITIES IN THESE EVENT RATES BY DISABILITY, RACE, AND ETHNICITY (AIM 3). FOR AIMS 2 AND 3 (2020-2026), WE WILL MEASURE DIFFERENCES IN THE LEVELS AND TRENDS OF HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES AND DISPARITIES BEFORE AND AFTER UNWINDING-RELATED CHANGES USING A MULTILEVEL APPROACH TO GROWTH CURVE MODELING THAT IS FLEXIBLE AND ROBUST TO MANY VALIDITY THREATS (WHILE ALSO UTILIZING ELIGIBLE NON-PARTICIPANTS WITH PAST SNAP APPLICATIONS AS A COMPARATOR WITH NO UNWINDING EXPOSURE).  CURRENT POLICY PROPOSALS WOULD REDUCE SNAP ACCESS, BUT THERE IS LITTLE DATA TO SHED LIGHT ON HOW SUCH REDUCTIONS MAY AFFECT HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES AND DISPARITIES.

BARRIERS TO HEALTH CARE ARE GENERALLY HIGH FOR PWD, AND DESPITE OVER THREE DECADES OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, MANY HEALTH CARE SETTINGS INCLUDING ADDICTION TREATMENT ARE NOT FULLY ACCESSIBLE FOR PWD. RECENT STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT PWD ABSTAIN FROM ALCOHOL MORE FREQUENTLY THAN PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES (PWOD); HOWEVER, AMONG CURRENT DRINKERS, PWD HAVE ELEVATED RATES OF AT-RISK ALCOHOL USE. FURTHERMORE, PWD HAVE GREATER RISK FOR ADDICTION, GIVEN HIGHER RATES OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH COMORBIDITIES, SOCIAL ISOLATION, TRAUMA HISTORY AND ADVERSE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. DESPITE THIS CONSTELLATION OF RISK FACTORS, VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT RISK FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD) OR ALCOHOL-RELATED MORBIDITY OR CONSEQUENCES AMONG PWD, OR WHETHER DISPARITIES EXIST FOR PWD IN ACCESSING OR ENGAGING IN AUD TREATMENT COMPARED TO PWOD. WE WILL USE RIGOROUS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL METHODS TO COMPARE PWD TO PWOD, USING HOUSEHOLD SURVEY DATA (NATIONAL SURVEY ON DRUG USE AND HEALTH) AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICAL CLAIMS DATASETS (MEDICAID IN 13 STATES; COMMERCIAL INSURANCE IN MARKETSCAN) TO EXAMINE ALCOHOL USE, AUD INDICATORS, MORBIDITY AND CONSEQUENCES, AUD TREATMENT SERVICES, QUALITY MEASURES AND OUTCOMES BY DISABILITY STATUS. DISABILITY STATUS IS DEFINED BY FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS IN SURVEY DATA AND BY DIAGNOSES OF DISABLING CONDITIONS IN CLAIMS. BECAUSE DISABILITY IS NOT HOMOGENEOUS, ANALYSES WILL CONSIDER ANY DISABILITY AND TYPES OF DISABILITY. ANALYSES WILL BE REPLICATED TO INVESTIGATE OUTCOMES FOR WOMEN WITH DISABILITIES, AN UNDERSTUDIED AND FURTHER STIGMATIZED POPULATION. OUR APPROACH IS ORGANIZED BY THE CASCADE OF CARE FRAMEWORK, AND INFORMED BY INTERSECTIONALITY, CRITICAL DISABILITY THEORY, AND THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE DEFINITION OF HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES THAT SEPARATES NEEDS-RELATED DIFFERENCES FROM TRUE DISPARITIES. THE PROPOSED SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO: 1) IDENTIFY DIFFERENCES IN ALCOHOL USE, ALCOHOL-RELATED MORBIDITY, AND AUD DIAGNOSES, BY DISABILITY STATUS; 2) AMONG PEOPLE WITH AUD, INVESTIGATE DISPARITIES BY DISABILITY STATUS IN ALCOHOL-RELATED MORBIDITY, CONSEQUENCES, AND ACCESS TO AUD TREATMENT; AND 3) AMONG PEOPLE RECEIVING AUD TREATMENT, ASSESS DISPARITIES BY DISABILITY STATUS IN RECEIVING QUALITY-ALIGNED AUD TREATMENT AND EXPERIENCING ACUTE ALCOHOL-RELATED OUTCOMES. OUR MULTIFACETED APPROACH TO DATA SOURCE SELECTION AND FOCUS ON DISPARITIES BETWEEN PWD AND PWOD WILL ALLOW A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF HOW THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY IS AFFECTED BY ALCOHOL PROBLEMS. FINDINGS ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE POLICY MAKERS, RESEARCHERS, AND CLINICIANS WITH CRITICAL INFORMATION TO ADDRESS DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO, ENGAGEMENT IN, AND OUTCOMES OF AUD TREATMENT FOR PWD, HELPING TO REDUCE ALCOHOL-RELATED MORBIDITY AND IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THIS COMMONLY OVERLOOKED HEALTH DISPARITY POPULATION.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,O,PRIVATE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01AA031236_7529/,2023-12-18

WE HAVE RECENTLY DISCOVERED A SUBSET OF HIPPOCAMPAL CA1 PLACE CELLS IN RATS THAT DISCRIMINATE TASTES BASED ON PALATABILITY, PROVIDING A FOUNDATION FOR ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS. WE FOUND THAT TASTE RESPONSIVE CA1 CELLS ENCODE TASTE PALATABILITY ON A SLOW TIMESCALE IN RESPONSE TO TASTE STIMULI, AND THESE TASTE RESPONSES ARE GATED BY THE SPATIAL RESPONSES OF INDIVIDUAL CELLS.

THE PROJECT TEAM INCLUDING AI RESEARCHERS AND EDUCATORS, STEM DISCIPLINARY EXPERTS AND THE BROADER CREATIVE WORKS COMMUNITY WILL EMPLOY A MIXTURE OF OUT-OF-SCHOOL AND ONLINE ACTIVITIES, INTEGRATING PLANETARY SCIENCE, PLANETARY EXPLORATION, BIG DATA, CREATIVE WORKS, AND GENERATIVE AI. THE WORKS CREATED BY YOUTHS WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF GENERATIVE AI AND VALIDATED BY SCIENTISTS ON PLANETARY EXPLORATION AND PLANETARY SCIENCE WILL BE SHOWCASED ONLINE, AT THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND ENERGY, AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES. THIS INTEGRATING RESEARCH & PRACTICE PROJECT IS FUNDED BY THE ADVANCING INFORMAL STEM LEARNING (AISL) PROGRAM, WHICH SUPPORTS PROJECTS THAT: (A) CONTRIBUTE TO RESEARCH AND PRACTICE THAT CONSIDERS INFORMAL STEM LEARNING'S ROLE IN EQUITY AND BELONGING IN STEM; (B) PROMOTE PERSONAL AND EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS IN STEM; (C) ADVANCE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IN SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY; (D) FOSTER INTEREST IN STEM CAREERS; (E) CREATE AND ENHANCE THE THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL FOUNDATIONS FOR EFFECTIVE INFORMAL STEM LEARNING; (F) IMPROVE COMMUNITY VIBRANCY; AND/OR (G) ENHANCE SCIENCE COMMUNICATION AND THE PUBLIC'S ENGAGEMENT IN AND UNDERSTANDING OF STEM AND STEM PROCESSES, AND CO-FUNDED BY THE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY EXPERIENCES FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS (ITEST) PROGRAM, WHICH SUPPORTS PROJECTS THAT BUILD UNDERSTANDINGS OF PRACTICES, PROGRAM ELEMENTS, CONTEXTS AND PROCESSES CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASING STUDENTS' KNOWLEDGE AND INTEREST IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) AND INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) CAREERS. OVER THE THREE-YEAR PROJECT DURATION, THE PROJECT WILL DIRECTLY IMPACT APPROXIMATELY 360 HIGH SCHOOL YOUTH AND WILL REACH OUT TO A MUCH LARGER NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS THROUGH ONLINE WEBINARS, WORKSHOPS, NEWSLETTERS, AND EXHIBITS. THE PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE FOUR RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (1) HOW DOES PARTICIPATION IN AN INTERDISCIPLINARY OUT-OF-SCHOOL STEM PROGRAM INFLUENCE HIGH SCHOOL YOUTHS' AI KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS, STEM ENGAGEMENT AND IDENTITY, AND SENSE OF BELONGING TO A SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY? (2) WHAT DO YOUTHS LEARN ABOUT THE VALUE OF THEIR PERSONAL AND CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS (I.E., ASSETS) TO THE LOCAL AND BROADER COMMUNITY? (3) WHAT PROGRAM CHALLENGES, FEATURES, AND CONTENT APPEAR TO HAVE THE GREATEST INFLUENCE ON ENGAGEMENT, IDENTITY, AND BELONGING? (4) HOW DO OUTCOMES VARY BY YOUTH DEMOGRAPHICS INCLUDING GENDER, ETHNICITY, AND URBAN/RURAL ENVIRONMENT? THE RESEARCH WILL USE A MIXED-METHODS DESIGN, COMBINING QUANTITATIVE SURVEYS WITH QUALITATIVE WRITTEN REFLECTIONS AND PICTURES WITH COMMENTARY. IN THE FINAL YEAR OF THE PROJECT, PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOPS WILL TRAIN EDUCATORS TO USE LEARNING MATERIALS GENERATED FROM THE PROJECT. RESEARCH FINDINGS PRODUCED THROUGH THIS WORK WILL CONTRIBUTE NEW KNOWLEDGE ON METHODS AND LEARNING DESIGNS IN INTEGRATING AI, STEM AND ART FOR INFORMAL STEM EDUCATION.

THESE REPRESENTATIONS ARE MODIFIED WITH EXPERIENCE ON THE TIMESCALE OF SECONDS TO MINUTES AND EVEN LIFETIMES. ALTHOUGH RECENT PIVOTAL WORK HAS PROVIDED INSIGHTS INTO HOW POPULATION ACTIVITY DRIVES MEMORY-GUIDED BEHAVIORS, MANY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT THE NEURAL PLASTICITY MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE THE FORMATION OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS IN RESPONSE TO NEW EXPERIENCES. THE STANDARD SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY RULE (I.E., SPIKE TIMING- DEPENDENT PLASTICITY, STDP) REQUIRES PRECISELY TIMED AND REPETITIVE PRE- AND POSTSYNAPTIC ACTIVATION, WHICH IS INCONGRUENT WITH THE SEEMINGLY CHAOTIC ACTIVITY OF NETWORKS IN AWAKE BEHAVING ANIMALS. IN CONTRAST, BEHAVIORAL TIMESCALE SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY (BTSP), A LEARNING RULE I RECENTLY CO-DISCOVERED TO UNDERLIE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXPERIENCE-DEPENDENT SPATIAL REPRESENTATIONS IN HIPPOCAMPAL CA1, REQUIRES ONLY A SINGLE INDUCTION TRIAL AND OPERATES ON THE COGNITIVELY RELEVANT TIMESCALE OF SECONDS. THUS, BTSP PROVIDES ONE OF THE FIRST BIOLOGICALLY PLAUSIBLE MECHANISMS FOR HOW A SINGLE EXPERIENCE CAN PRODUCE LEARNING-RELATED CHANGES IN BRAIN ACTIVITY.

USING THIS APPROACH, WE WILL DETERMINE THE FLOW OF INFORMATION THROUGH THE MEC NETWORK.

MITOCHONDRIA EMPLOY SEVERAL AAA+ FAMILY PROTEIN UNFOLDASES AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS CONTROL. WE HERE FOCUS ON THE AAA+ PROTEIN UNFOLDASE CLPX, WHICH CAN ACT ON ITS OWN OR UNFOLD PROTEINS FOR COUPLED DEGRADATION BY ITS PARTNER PROTEASE CLPP. LOSS OF CLPX IS LETHAL IN MICE, MUTATIONS IN CLPX AND CLPP CAUSE MITOCHONDRIOPATHIES, AND CLPXP DRIVES CANCER PROGRESSION AND IS TARGETED BY DRUGS IN CLINICAL TRIALS IN A DIVERSE RANGE OF CANCERS. THESE PHENOTYPES INDICATE THE CRUCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF CLPX AND CLPP TO MITOCHONDRIAL PHYSIOLOGY. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO REVEAL THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH CLPX SELECTS SUBSTRATES AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME, THUS TAILORING THEIR FUNCTION TO MITOCHONDRIAL AND CELLULAR NEEDS. PROTEOMIC STUDIES HAVE LINKED CLPX TO MULTIPLE LIKELY SUBSTRATES THAT CONTROL CORE MITOCHONDRIAL PROCESSES, ALTHOUGH ONLY A FEW HAVE BEEN FURTHER CHARACTERIZED, AND MECHANISMS FOR CONDITIONAL SUBSTRATE SELECTION REMAIN LARGELY UNDETERMINED. ONE OF THE BEST-CHARACTERIZED FUNCTIONS FOR CLPX IS TO REGULATE HEME BIOSYNTHESIS, A CRUCIAL MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION, BY ACTING ON THE FIRST ENZYME IN THIS PATHWAY, ALA SYNTHASE (ALAS). CLPX ACTIVATES ALAS BY PARTIAL UNFOLDING TO FACILITATE COFACTOR INCORPORATION. WHEN HEME LEVELS ARE HIGH, CLPX (WITH ITS PARTNER PROTEASE CLPP) ALSO APPEARS TO INACTIVATE ALAS BY COMPLETE UNFOLDING AND DEGRADATION, SIGNALED BY A HEME-BINDING SITE IN ALAS. IN PRELIMINARY RESULTS, WE HAVE BIOCHEMICALLY RECONSTITUTED HEME-INDUCED DEGRADATION OF ALAS BY CLPXP, CONFIRMING THE DIRECT NATURE OF THIS ACTIVITY. WE ADDITIONALLY DISCOVERED THAT DEGRADATION STRONGLY DEPENDS ON A HEME-SENSITIVE ADAPTOR PROTEIN. THE PROJECT PROPOSED HERE WILL (1) ELUCIDATE THE MECHANISM BY WHICH HEME DRIVES ASSEMBLY AND LICENSING OF A DEGRADATION COMPLEX FOR ALAS, USING OUR RECONSTITUTED SYSTEM WITH EQUILIBRIUM-BINDING AND KINETIC ANALYSES OF COMPLEX ASSEMBLY AND ALAS DEGRADATION IN PARALLEL WITH OBSERVATIONS IN CELLS. (2) WE WILL DETERMINE HOW HEME IS DIRECTLY SENSED WITHIN THE COMPLEX USING SPECTROSCOPIC AND STRUCTURAL METHODS AND TEST HOW THE HEME-RESPONSIVENESS OF THIS SYSTEM IS TUNED TO SUIT DIFFERENT CELLULAR PROGRAMS. (3) WE WILL DETERMINE HOW A HEME-SENSITIVE ADAPTOR IN THE CLPXP DEGRADATION COMPLEX TUNES SUBSTRATE SELECTION BY CLPX BEYOND ALAS, USING A CANDIDATE-BASED APPROACH AND AN UNBIASED PROTEOMIC APPROACH IN PARALLEL.

IN AIM 2, FLP-FRT RECOMBINATION WILL BE USED TO DELETE EITHER THE CAMKII CATALYTIC DOMAIN OR THE 3’UTR AND THE EFFECT ON POTENTIATION OF MEJP FREQUENCY WILL BE DETERMINED. THE EXCISION OF THE DOMAINS WILL BE DONE EXCLUSIVELY IN THE PRESYNAPTIC OR POSTSYNAPTIC COMPARTMENT, SO THAT THE CONTRIBUTION OF EITHER THE MOTONEURON OR MUSCLE CAN BE CLEARLY SEPARATED. IN AIM 3, THE SUBCELLULAR LOCALIZATION OF NEWLY-SYNTHESIZED CAMKII WILL BE COMPARED TO THAT OF PRE-EXISTING CAMKII. THE FUNCTION OF THIS NEWLY-SYNTHESIZED CAMKII POOL IS UNKNOWN, AND THIS EXPERIMENT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THE NEWLY-SYNTHESIZED CAMKII IS TARGETED TO A DISTINCT SUBCELLULAR NANODOMAIN. ULTIMATELY, THIS RESEARCH PLAN WILL CLARIFY HOW COMPARTMENT-SPECIFIC CAMKII SYNTHESIS MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO LONG-TERM FUNCTIONAL CHANGES IN THE SYNAPSE AND MAY IDENTIFY NEW AVENUES OF RESEARCH INTO CAMKII-DEPENDENT PLASTICITY.

TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION, I WILL USE THE BUDDING YEAST S. CEREVISIAE, WHERE SEPTINS WERE FIRST DISCOVERED, AND WHERE I AM READILY ABLE TO COMBINE A ‘BOTTOM UP’ IN VITRO RECONSTITUTION AND SINGLE MOLECULE IMAGING APPROACH WITH A ‘TOP DOWN’ GENETICS AND LIVE IMAGING APPROACH. THE PROPOSAL BUILDS OFF OF RECENT DISCOVERIES MADE IN THE GOODE LAB, WHICH REVEAL THAT SEPTINS ARE ORGANIZED AT THE YEAST BUD NECK INTO 8-10 EVENLY-SPACED BARS, OR “PILLARS”, WHICH CO-ALIGN WITH F-ACTIN CABLES USED FOR INTRACELLULAR TRANSPORT. WHILE WORK IN A NUMBER OF MODEL ORGANISMS HAS CLOSELY LINKED THE IN VIVO FUNCTIONS OF SEPTINS AND ACTIN, WE STILL HAVE ONLY A LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THIS SEPTIN-ACTIN CROSSTALK. THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO DEFINE THESE MECHANISMS. S. CEREVISIAE EXPRESS 5 DIFFERENT SEPTIN PROTEINS, WHICH CO-POLYMERIZE INTO FILAMENTS AND ARE FURTHER ORGANIZED INTO HIGHER ORDER STRUCTURES. MY PRELIMINARY DATA SHOW THAT ONE OF THE SEPTINS (SHS1) MEDIATES DIRECT BINDING TO F-ACTIN IN VITRO, AND THAT LOSS OF SHS1 DISRUPTS ACTIN CABLE ARCHITECTURE AND FUNCTION IN VIVO. IN AIM1, I WILL USE TARGETED MUTAGENESIS TO GENERATE NEW SHS1 SEPARATION-OF-FUNCTION MUTANTS DISRUPTING F-ACTIN BINDING. I WILL THEN USE THESE MUTANTS TO INVESTIGATE HOW SHS1-MEDIATED F-ACTIN BINDING CONTRIBUTES TO THE ALIGNMENT OF ACTIN CABLES WITH SEPTIN PILLARS IN VIVO, AND INTRACELLULAR TRANSPORT OF SECRETORY VESICLES. IN AIM2, I WILL RECONSTITUTE PURIFIED SEPTIN OLIGOMERS AND FILAMENTS DECORATED WITH ACTIN- NUCLEATING FORMINS (BNR1) AND FORMIN-REGULATORY PROTEINS (E.G., GIN4, BUD6, AND THE MLC1-IQG1-HOF1 COMPLEX), AND DEFINE THEIR EFFECTS ON F-ACTIN ASSEMBLY AND ORGANIZATION BY TIRF MICROSCOPY AND SINGLE MOLECULE IMAGING. THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL TEST SEVERAL IMPORTANT HYPOTHESES, INCLUDING: (1) WHETHER SEPTINS AND GIN4 ACTIVATE FULL- LENGTH BNR1 FROM AUTOINHIBITION TO PROMOTE ACTIN ASSEMBLY; (2) WHETHER IQG1 HAS REGULATORY EFFECTS ON F-ACTIN AND BNR1, LIKE ITS HUMAN COUNTERPART IQGAP1 (BASED ON A RECENT STUDY FROM THE GOODE LAB; HOEPRICH ET AL., 2022); AND (3) WHETHER SEPTIN OLIGOMERS/FILAMENTS THEMSELVES (VIA SHS1) DIRECTLY INFLUENCE F-ACTIN BUNDLING AND DYNAMICS. IN PARALLEL TO THESE IN VITRO EXPERIMENTS, I WILL ACUTELY DEPLETE THE SAME PROTEINS IN VIVO (USING DEGRON TAGS) TO DETERMINE HOW EACH CONTRIBUTES TO THE ASSEMBLY AND ALIGNMENT OF ACTIN CABLES AT THE BUD NECK. MY PRELIMINARY DATA ALREADY POINT TO AN EXCITING NEW ROLE FOR IQG1 IN CONTROLLING ACTIN CABLE FORMATION DURING POLARIZED CELL GROWTH. TOGETHER, THE IN VITRO AND IN VIVO WORK OUTLINED IN THIS PROPOSAL WILL: (I) CLARIFY HOW SEPTINS, FORMINS, AND FORMIN-REGULATORY PROTEINS WORK IN CONCERT TO SHAPE ACTIN NETWORKS, (II) DEFINE NEW SUBUNIT-SPECIFIC ROLES FOR SEPTINS IN ACTIN REGULATION, (III) LAY A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR LAUNCHING MY OWN LAB FOCUSED ON SEPTIN-ACTIN CROSSTALK, AND (IV) PROVIDE NEW LEADS THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO EXTEND THIS WORK IN THE FUTURE (ON MY OWN AND VIA COLLABORATION) INTO OTHER SYSTEMS.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,O,PRIVATE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_F32GM150204_7529/,2024-05-20

ADVANCES IN HUMAN NEUROIMAGING APPROACHES THAT QUANTIFY PATHOLOGY IN VIVO HAVE REVEALED A PROMISING TARGET FOR AD THERAPEUTICS KNOWN AS COGNITIVE RESERVE, WHICH IS THE CAPACITY FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED COGNITION GIVEN THEIR LEVEL OF PATHOLOGY.

MANY SELF-ASSEMBLY PROCESSES IN BIOLOGY ARE ?SELF-LIMITED?, MEANING THAT ASSEMBLY AUTOMATICALLY STOPS AT A PARTICULAR SIZE AND STRUCTURE. THESE SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLIES PERFORM IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS IN BIOLOGICAL CELLS, AND THUS UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY WORK WOULD ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE AND DISEASES. MOREOVER, LEARNING TO DESIGN SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLY PROCESSES IN SYNTHETIC SYSTEMS COULD ENABLE IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, THE ACHIEVABLE SIZES AND YIELDS OF ASSEMBLED STRUCTURES ARE CURRENTLY MUCH SMALLER THAN THOSE OF NATURAL SYSTEMS. THIS LIMITATION ARISES BECAUSE THE FIELD LACKS THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE DESIGNING THE SUBUNITS AND REACTION CONDITIONS TO ENSURE ROBUST, EFFICIENT ASSEMBLY. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP SUCH THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES, BY USING COMPUTATION AND THEORY TO UNDERSTAND MECHANISMS THAT BIOLOGY USES MAKE SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLY EFFICIENT, AND TO LEARN HOW TO APPLY THEM TO SYNTHETIC ASSEMBLIES. THE PROJECT WILL UNDERTAKE THREE THRUSTS, EACH OF WHICH INVESTIGATES A DIFFERENT MECHANISM. THE FIRST THRUST WILL STUDY HOW USING MULTIPLE SPECIES OF SUBUNITS WITH DIFFERENT INTERACTIONS CAN INCREASE ACHIEVABLE ASSEMBLY SIZES AND YIELD. THE SECOND THRUST WILL INVESTIGATE HOW VARYING REACTION CONDITIONS IN TIME CAN INCREASE ASSEMBLY RATES AND YIELDS. THE INVESTIGATORS WILL COMBINE NEW COMPUTATIONAL METHODS WITH A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK CALLED OPTIMAL CONTROL THEORY TO DEVELOP EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS TO DETERMINE TIME-SEQUENCES OF REACTION CONDITIONS THAT MAXIMIZE YIELDS. THE THIRD THRUST WILL STUDY SELF-ASSEMBLY WITHIN PHASE-SEPARATED DROPLETS. LIQUID-LIQUID PHASE SEPARATION REFERS TO THE DE-MIXING OF A SOLUTION INTO DROPLETS WITH DIFFERENT CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS, SUCH AS WHEN OIL AND WATER SEPARATE. DURING SOME VIRUS INFECTIONS, THE VIRUS REMODELS ITS HOST CELL TO FORM PHASE-SEPARATED DROPLETS WITHIN WHICH NEW VIRAL PARTICLES ASSEMBLE. THIS PROJECT WILL STUDY HOW ASSEMBLY RATES AND YIELDS DEPEND ON PROPERTIES OF THE PHASE-SEPARATED DROPLETS, SUCH AS THEIR SIZE AND THE TENDENCY OF SUBUNITS TO LOCALLY CONCENTRATE INSIDE OF THE DROPLETS. RESULTS FROM EACH THRUST WILL BE TESTED AGAINST EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED BY COLLABORATORS, IN WHICH DNA ORIGAMI OR PROTEIN DESIGN IS USED TO CREATE SUBUNITS THAT ASSEMBLE INTO SYMMETRIC SHELLS, HELICAL TUBULES, AND OTHER STRUCTURES. THE RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICAL (STEM) TRAINING FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS, AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN PHYSICS AND BIOLOGY. THE RESEARCH PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO RECRUIT DIVERSE STUDENTS, AND TRAIN THEM IN COMPUTATIONAL RESEARCH AS WELL AS EFFECTIVE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION TO EXPERT AND NON-EXPERT AUDIENCES. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO INCLUDE PROGRAMS IN WHICH THE RESEARCHERS DESCRIBE THEIR RESULTS TO THE PUBLIC. THESE EFFORTS WILL INCLUDE A PROGRAM INTEGRATED IN THE PHYSICS CURRICULUM OF A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL, IN WHICH STUDENTS ENGAGE IN A HANDS-ON ACTIVITY THAT EXPLAINS THE PHYSICS AND GEOMETRY OF SELF-ASSEMBLY IN VIRUSES AND TECHNOLOGY, WHILE CONVEYING THE WONDER, EXCITEMENT, AND IMPACT ON SOCIETY OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. TECHNICAL SUMMARY THE SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLY OF PROTEIN SUBUNITS INTO FINITE-SIZED STRUCTURES WITH WELL-DEFINED ARCHITECTURES IS A HALLMARK OF LIFE. SUCH STRUCTURES ABOUND IN NATURE, WHERE THEY PERFORM ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF CELLS AND THE PATHOGENS THAT INFECT THEM. RECENTLY, ADVANCES IN DNA ORIGAMI AND PROTEIN DESIGN HAVE ENABLED ENGINEERING SYNTHETIC SUBUNITS THAT ARE PROGRAMMED FOR SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLY, WITH ATOMIC-SCALE PRECISION RIVALING THAT OF NATURAL PROTEINS. YET, ACHIEVABLE SIZES AND YIELDS OF ASSEMBLED STRUCTURES FALL FAR SHORT OF NATURE, DUE TO A LACK OF THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE DESIGNING SUBUNITS AND REACTION CONDITIONS FOR ROBUST, EFFICIENT ASSEMBLY. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO OVERCOME THIS LIMITATION, BY USING COMPUTATION TO UNDERSTAND MECHANISMS THAT BIOLOGY USES TO CIRCUMVENT CONSTRAINTS ON ASSEMBLY TIMESCALES: TUNABLE ?SUBUNIT COMPLEXITY?, BY HAVING MULTIPLE SUBUNIT SPECIES WITH SPECIFIC INTERACTIONS, AND NONEQUILIBRIUM SPATIOTEMPORALLY VARYING ASSEMBLY DRIVING FORCES. THE PROJECT WILL UNDERTAKE THREE COMPLEMENTARY THRUSTS. THRUST 1 INVESTIGATES HOW SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLY DEPENDS ON SUBUNIT COMPLEXITY, TO IDENTIFY GENERAL STRATEGIES TO INCREASE YIELDS. THRUST 2 COMBINES MARKOV STATE MODELS WITH OPTIMAL CONTROL THEORY TO DEVELOP EFFICIENT ALGORITHMS FOR OPTIMIZING TIME-DEPENDENT ASSEMBLY PROTOCOLS. THRUST 3 WILL USE SIMULATIONS TO UNDERSTAND HOW SELF-ASSEMBLY IS AFFECTED BY A PROMINENT FORM OF SPATIAL CONTROL IN CELLS ? LIQUID-LIQUID PHASE SEPARATION. THE RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE HOW LIQUID-LIQUID PHASE SEPARATION CAN ACCELERATE ASSEMBLY AND ENHANCE ROBUSTNESS AGAINST PARAMETER VARIATIONS. RESULTS FROM EACH THRUST WILL BE TESTED AGAINST EXPERIMENTS PERFORMED BY COLLABORATORS, IN WHICH DNA ORIGAMI OR PROTEIN DESIGN IS USED TO CREATE SUBUNITS THAT ASSEMBLE INTO ICOSAHEDRAL CAPSIDS, HELICAL TUBULES, AND OTHER STRUCTURES. ASSEMBLING LARGE TARGET STRUCTURES IS CHALLENGING BECAUSE ASSEMBLY RATES ARE CONSTRAINED BY COMPETING THERMODYNAMIC AND KINETIC EFFECTS. THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY LACKS STRATEGIES TO ENGINEER ASSEMBLY REACTIONS THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY SATISFY THESE TRADE-OFFS, DUE TO CRUCIAL GAPS IN SELF-ASSEMBLY THEORY: (1) PREVIOUS MODELS HAVE FOCUSED ON MINIMAL SUBUNIT COMPLEXITY (ASSEMBLY FROM ONE SUBUNIT SPECIES) OR MAXIMAL COMPLEXITY (ADDRESSABLE ASSEMBLY, IN WHICH EACH SUBUNIT IS UNIQUE); (2) OPTIMIZING TIME-DEPENDENT ASSEMBLY PROTOCOLS FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN COMPUTATIONALLY INTRACTABLE FOR MOST SYSTEMS; (3) DESPITE INTENSIVE RESEARCH ON LIQUID-LIQUID PHASE SEPARATION, ITS EFFECT ON SELF-ASSEMBLY HAS RECEIVED RELATIVELY LITTLE ATTENTION. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP COMPUTATIONAL MODELS AND TOOLS THAT OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS. THRUST 1 WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC STUDY ACROSS THE FULL RANGE OF SUBUNIT COMPLEXITY, TO IDENTIFY OPTIMAL LEVELS OF COMPLEXITY AND THE EFFECTS OF GEOMETRIC FRUSTRATION OR REDUNDANT INTERACTIONS THAT ARISE AT LOW OR HIGH COMPLEXITY. THRUST 2 WILL LEVERAGE THE PROPERTIES OF MARKOV STATE MODELS TO DEVELOP A HIGHLY EFFICIENT OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK THAT IS APPLICABLE TO DIVERSE SELF-ASSEMBLY SYSTEMS. THE INVESTIGATORS WILL USE THIS FRAMEWORK TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL TIME-DEPENDENT PROTOCOLS FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLY. THRUST 3 WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST MODELS FOR SELF-LIMITED ASSEMBLY COUPLED TO LIQUID-LIQUID PHASE SEPARATION. BY ESTABLISHING DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR ENGINEERING SUBUNITS THAT CAN BE PREPROGRAMMED TO ASSEMBLE INTO ARBITRARY THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURES, THIS RESEARCH WILL PAVE THE WAY TO HIGHLY SCALABLE MANUFACTURING OF NANOSTRUCTURED MATERIALS FOR BIOMEDICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS. THE RESULTS ALSO MAKE A KEY STEP TOWARD A THEORY OF LIVING MATTER, BY ELUCIDATING SELF-ASSEMBLY MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS IN BIOLOGICAL CELLS AND PATHOGENS. THE COMPUTATIONAL ALGORITHMS DEVELOPED FOR THIS RESEARCH WILL BE BROADLY APPLICABLE TO SELF-ASSEMBLY. THE RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE INTERDISCIPLINARY STEM TRAINING FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS, AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN SOFT MATTER PHYSICS AND CELL BIOLOGY. THE RESEARCH PROGRAM WILL RECRUIT DIVERSE STUDENTS, AND TRAIN THEM IN COMPUTATIONAL RESEARCH AS WELL AS EFFECTIVE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION TO EXPERT AND NON-EXPERT AUDIENCES.

THEREFORE, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THERE IS A STRONG LINK BETWEEN PERTURBATION OF RNA METABOLISM AND A NUMBER OF NEUROLOGICAL AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. THESE INCLUDE ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE (AD) IN WHICH TAU PROTEIN AND ASS42 FRAGMENTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INTERACT AND/OR MODULATE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RNA BINDING PROTEINS AND RNA METABOLISM IN GENERAL. CIRCULAR RNAS (CIRCRNAS) ARE HIGHLY ABUNDANT RNAS PRODUCED BY CIRCULARIZATION OF SPECIFIC EXONS.

INDEED, SPECIFIC CIRCRNAS ACCUMULATE IN THE BRAINS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH PARKINSON’S AND ALZHEIMER’S DISEASES. HOWEVER, HOW THESE CIRCRNAS ARE INVOLVED IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF THOSE AND OTHER NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED SYSTEMS TO DOWN- OR UP-REGULATE CIRCRNAS IN DROSOPHILA. USING THESE TOOLS, WE DEMONSTRATED THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THESE MOLECULES IN VIVO. WE GENERATED A RESOURCE TO KNOCK DOWN (KD) THE 110 MORE ABUNDANT CIRCRNAS AND FOUND THAT KD OF PARTICULAR CIRCRNAS RESULTS IN DIFFERENT BRAIN-RELATED PHENOTYPES. INTERESTINGLY, WE IDENTIFIED 35 CIRCRNAS THAT WHEN KNOCKED DOWN ALTER LIFESPAN. FURTHER DATA SHOWS THAT EXPRESSION OF SOME CIRCRNAS IS TOXIC FOR THE AGING FLY, WITH LINKS TO AGING AND POTENTIALLY NEURODEGENERATION. IN ADDITION, WE FOUND THAT KD OF SOME CIRCRNAS LEAD TO SPECIFIC BEHAVIORAL AND MOTOR DEFECTS, MANY OF WHICH ARE AGE-DEPENDENT. IN ADDITION, WE OBSERVED CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF CIRCRNAS IN DROSOPHILA MODELS OF AD OR OTHER NEUROGENERATIVE DISEASES. HERE WE AIM TO UNCOVER THE FUNCTIONS AND MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF CIRCRNAS DURING AD. TO DO SO, WE WILL USE DROSOPHILA AD MODELS AND PERFORM A GENOMIC SCREENING TO DETERMINE IF MODULATION OF INDIVIDUAL CIRCRNAS CAN ALTER THE PROGRESSION AND OUTCOME OF THE DISEASE.

UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, CHANGE IS OFTEN NOT A CHOICE. CELLS INEVITABLY FIND NEW WAYS TO ADAPT AND SURVIVE UPON EXPOSURE TO ACUTE STRESS. BACTERIAL CELLS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO ANTIBIOTICS ACQUIRE RESISTANCE THROUGH CHANGES TO THEIR DNA SEQUENCE. PLANTS MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR FLOWERING TIMES BASED ON THEIR TIME OF EXPOSURE TO COLD CONDITIONS. CANCER CELLS, WHEN EXPOSED TO CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS, CAN BECOME RESISTANT, POSING A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO TREATMENT AND WORSENING PATIENT OUTCOMES. IN MANY CASES, THESE ADAPTIVE CHANGES ARE EPIGENETIC - THEY RESULT IN GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES WITHOUT ANY ALTERATIONS TO THE GENETIC BLUEPRINT. IN CONTRAST TO GENETIC MUTATIONS, EPIGENETIC CHANGES CAN BE TRANSIENT, HERITABLE AND REVERSIBLE PROVIDING DIVERSE PATHWAYS FOR CELLULAR INNOVATION. THE THOUSANDS OF GENES WITHIN THE NUCLEUS OF EACH CELL SERVE AS TUNABLE KNOBS THAT CAN ALTER CELL FITNESS.

YET POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION, INCLUDING TRANSLATIONAL REGULATION AND THE ROLE OF RNA BINDING PROTEINS (RBPS), HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AS IMPORTANT IN RECENT YEARS. MOREOVER, UNDERSTANDING THE ROLES OF RBPS IN DIVERSE CELL TYPES AND DISEASES AND ULTIMATELY THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION REQUIRES IDENTIFYING THE RNA TARGETS OF RBPS. THE RIBOSOME CAN BE CONSIDERED A RBP, SO THIS FOCUS ON POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION AND RBP TARGETS INCLUDES IDENTIFYING RIBOSOME-ASSOCIATED TRANSCRIPTS, NAMELY RNAS THAT CHANGE THEIR TRANSLATIONAL STATUS UNDER DEFINED CIRCUMSTANCES. RBP IDENTIFICATION IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING FROM SMALL NUMBERS OF CELLS, E.G., CANCER STEM CELLS WITHIN A LARGE, HETEROGENEOUS SOLID TUMOR OR DISCRETE NEURONAL SUBTYPES. THESE SETTINGS PRECLUDE TRADITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND THEREFORE REQUIRE NEW APPROACHES. TWO NEW METHODS RECENTLY APPEARED, TRIBE AND STAMP, WHICH EXPLOIT THE RNA EDITING ENZYMES ADAR AND APOBEC, RESPECTIVELY. THEIR RIBOSOME VERSIONS, RIBO-STAMP AND RIBO-TRIBE, ARE EVEN MORE RECENT AND FUSE A RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN TO THE EDITING ENZYMES. THIS IS SO THAT THE ENZYME WILL BE NEAR RNAS THAT ARE BEING TRANSLATED AND WILL “MARK” THEM BY CHANGING THEIR SEQUENCE. THESE EDITS ARE IDENTIFIED BY MRNA SEQUENCING AND STRAIGHTFORWARD COMPUTATIONAL METHODS, EVEN FROM SINGLE CELLS. WE PROPOSE TO COMPARE RIBO-STAMP AND RIBO-TRIBE SIDE-BY-SIDE IN MAMMALIAN CELL CULTURE SYSTEMS, TO ASSESS THEIR EFFICACY AND TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION OF RIBOSOME-EDITING ENZYME FUSIONS. WE ALSO PROPOSE TO DEVELOP RIBO-TRIBE FOR USE IN DROSOPHILA; WE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT STAMP DOES NOT WORK IN THIS ORGANISM, WHICH LIMITS US TO TRIBE. WE WILL THEN EXTEND THESE METHODS TO THE MORE BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT OF NEURONS, FROM DROSOPHILA AS WELL AS FROM MOUSE BRAINS. TO COMPLEMENT THESE EFFORTS, WE WILL DEVELOP AN EXTENSION OF THE TRIBE/STAMP THEME CALLED NANOBODY-EDITING. IT CONSISTS OF FUSING THE EDITING ENZYME, ADAR OR APOBEC, TO A GFP-NANOBODY, WHICH WILL THEN DELIVER THE EDITING ENZYME TO ANY GFP-TAGGED RNA BINDING PROTEIN OR GFP-TAGGED RIBOSOME. THE CHIMERIC, RECOMBINANT PROTEIN WILL BE USED IN VITRO AS A RECOMBINANT PROTEIN OR EXPRESSED IN VIVO. NANOBODY- EDITING WILL FACILITATE IDENTIFYING RBP AND RIBOSOME TARGETS, BECAUSE ALREADY EXISTING GFP-TAGGED RBP OR RIBOSOMES CAN SERVE AS SUBSTRATES. MOREOVER, IN VITRO EDITING WILL IN MANY CASES OBVIATE THE NEED TO GENERATE NEW TRANSGENES AND TRANSGENIC ANIMALS. LASTLY, TRIBE AND AS WELL AS RIBO-TRIBE WILL BE USED TO CHARACTERIZE TRANSLATIONAL REGULATION “AROUND THE CLOCK” WITHIN A FEW KEY DROSOPHILA CIRCADIAN NEURONS.

SIMILAR DENSE SUSPENSIONS INCLUDE CEMENT, CERAMICS, AND MUD. THESE SUSPENSIONS ARE OFTEN SO PACKED WITH PARTICLES THAT SMALL CHANGES IN FLOW RATE MAY CAUSE THEM TO STOP FLOWING AND JAM INTO A SOLID. SURPRISINGLY, A PREDICTIVE THEORY FOR THIS BEHAVIOR IS LACKING. ONE OBSTACLE IS FIGURING OUT HOW INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TWO PARTICLES CAUSE THE BEHAVIOR SEEN WHEN MANY PARTICLES ARE PUT TOGETHER. THE RESEARCH SUPPORTED BY THIS AWARD IS FOCUSED ON CREATING UNDERSTANDING USING A COMBINATION OF THEORY, NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS, AND ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA. SINCE THE BEHAVIOR OF SUSPENSIONS IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE IN EXPERIMENTS AND NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS THAT SHOW GOOD AGREEMENT, THEY ARE AN IDEAL SYSTEM FOR EXPLORING THE LARGER QUESTION OF HOW MATERIALS CHANGE PROPERTIES DUE TO FLOW CONDITIONS.

USING A DISCRETE-PARTICLE SIMULATION APPROACH THAT INCORPORATES PARTICLE FRICTIONAL CONTACT AT STRESS ABOVE A THRESHOLD LEVEL, THE BEHAVIOR OF THE DISCONTINUOUS SHEAR THICKENING (DST) AND SHEAR JAMMING (SJ) TRANSITIONS WILL BE EXPLORED.

THIS WILL BE COMPLEMENTED BY ANALYSIS OF DIVERGENT SHEAR AND NORMAL STRESS AS JAMMING IS APPROACHED; THE ANALYSIS WILL APPLY METHODS OF CROSSOVER SCALING, A RENORMALIZATION GROUP METHOD ESPECIALLY USEFUL WHEN BEHAVIOR IS INFLUENCED BY TWO SINGULAR POINTS: THIS IS SEEN IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM AS IT UNDERGOES TWO FORMS OF JAMMING, ONE DUE TO GEOMETRICALLY-DETERMINED FRICTIONLESS CONTACTS AT VANISHING STRESS AND THE OTHER DUE TO STRESS-INDUCED FRICTIONAL CONTACTS AT LARGE STRESS. THE CONTINUUM DESCRIPTION OF SUSPENSION FLOW IN A NOVEL DIRECTION, BY EXTENSION OF RECENT APPROACHES TO DESCRIBE THE EMERGENT ELASTICITY OF JAMMED AMORPHOUS PACKINGS WILL ALSO BE INVESTIGATED. THIS DIRECTION OF WORK IS BASED ON A POSTULATE THAT RIGIDITY ON PROGRESSIVELY LARGER SCALES IS INDUCED BY INCREASE OF THE STRESS, WHICH IN A SUFFICIENTLY DENSE SUSPENSION LEADS TO A PERCOLATION OF RIGIDITY AND JAMMING; THE CONTINUUM THEORY IS BASED IN THE INVESTIGATION OF MOTION CORRELATIONS BY SIMULATION.

THIS PROJECT UNCOVERS HOW POPULATIONS OF PHYSICALLY INTERACTING CELLS MECHANICALLY RESPOND TO CHALLENGING CONDITIONS AND MODIFY THEIR COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR TO STILL SCULPT THE CORRECT FINAL SHAPE.  ONE WAY FOR CELLS TO COORDINATE TISSUE-SCALE FORCES AND MOVEMENTS IS THROUGH DIRECT MECHANICAL CONNECTIONS. IN FACT, MANY DEVELOPING TISSUES EXHIBIT SUPRACELLULAR NETWORKS OF ACTOMYOSIN CONNECTIONS THAT LINK HUNDREDS OF CELLS. A LARGE ROADBLOCK HAS BEEN WITH THE CHALLENGES OF IMAGING AND QUANTIFYING SUBCELLULAR PROTEIN AT THE TISSUE SCALE. I ADAPTED A TOPOLOGICAL SMOOTHING ALGORITHM ORIGINALLY USED TO TRACE HIGH-NOISE FILAMENTOUS STRUCTURE OF GALAXIES IN THE UNIVERSE TO DATA TO TRACE HIGH-NOISE FILAMENTOUS MYOSIN STRUCTURE IN CONFOCAL IMAGES. THIS ALLOWED FOR THE FIRST QUANTIFICATION OF A SUPRACELLULAR MYOSIN NETWORK ACROSS AN ENTIRE TISSUE OVER DEVELOPMENTAL TIME. SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS ADOPTING TECHNIQUES FROM NETWORK THEORY ALLOWED ME TO IDENTIFY THAT THE ROBUST FOLDING OF THE DROSOPHILA FRUIT FLY EMBRYO DURING VENTRAL FURROW FORMATION IS MECHANICALLY ENSURED BY PATTERNS IN THE SUPRACELLULAR NETWORK SPANNING ITS VENTRAL CELLS.

DECIPHERING ROBUSTNESS AT THE TISSUE-LEVEL, WHERE THE DISPLACEMENT AND FATE OF HUNDREDS OF CELLS MUST BE CONSIDERED, REQUIRES TECHNIQUES AT THE INTERFACE OF CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY, BIOPHYSICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE.

IMPROVING APPROACHES FOR GENETIC INVESTIGATIONS IN AE. AEGYPTI WILL FACILITATE THESE EFFORTS.  TO DATE, GENETIC INVESTIGATIONS IN AE. AEGYPTI OFTEN RELY ON CRISPR/CAS9-MEDIATED GENE TARGETING TO CREATE STRAINS OF HOMOZYGOUS MUTANT ANIMALS IN WHICH A GENE OF INTEREST HAS BEEN DISRUPTED. WHILE EXTREMELY VALUABLE, SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT IS REQUIRED TO CREATE EACH MUTANT AND THE MUTANTS OBTAINED LACK CELL-SPECIFICITY. TO ADDRESS THESE LIMITATIONS, WE PROPOSE TO ESTABLISH A CELL-SPECIFIC, MODIFIED CRISPR/CAS9 (CMC) TOOLKIT FOR AE. AEGYPTI. CMC IS DESIGNED TO DECREASE THE EFFORT REQUIRED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF DISRUPTING A GENE OF INTEREST, ALLOW THE CELLS IN WHICH A GENE IS ACTING TO BE DETERMINED AND AID THE STUDY OF ESSENTIAL GENES. WE PROPOSE TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS IN TWO AIMS: AIM #1: INTRODUCE THE TOOLS FOR CELL-SPECIFIC MODIFIED CRISPR/CAS9 (CMC) INTO AE. AEGYPTI IN AIM 1A, WE DESIGN A STRATEGY AND BUILD TOOLS FOR CREATING MOSQUITO STRAINS THAT EXPRESS MODIFIED CAS9 TRANSGENES DESIGNED TO ALLOW OPTIMIZATION OF CAS9 LEVELS. IN AIM 1A2, WE USE THESE TOOLS TO CREATE MOSQUITOES THAT EXPRESS MODIFIED CAS9 TRANSGENES IN A SPECIFIC SUBSET OF SENSORY NEURONS. IN AIM 1B, WE CREATE TRANSGENES THAT EXPRESS MULTIPLE GRNAS IN A CELL-SPECIFIC FASHION TO SPECIFY THE GENES TARGETED. AIM 2: IMPLEMENT CMC IN A SUBSET OF SENSORY NEURONS AS WELL AS PAN-NEURONALLY IN AIM 2A, WE TEST THE SYSTEM, USING THE TOOLS BUILT TO IDENTIFY AN OPTIMAL STRAIN WHICH PROMOTES ROBUST CELL- SPECIFIC GENE DISRUPTION IN A SUBSET OF SENSORY NEURONS, WITHOUT CAUSING CELL DEATH. IN AIM 2B, WE CONSTRUCT MOSQUITO STRAINS THAT WILL ENABLE BROAD NEURON-SPECIFIC GENE DISRUPTION, WHICH SHOULD BE OF WIDE UTILITY.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,O,PRIVATE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R21AI174516_7529/,2024-05-20

FLOW PHENOMENA IN NATURE AND IN ENGINEERED SYSTEMS ARE TYPICALLY DRIVEN BY EXTERNAL FORCES SUCH AS GRAVITY AND PRESSURE GRADIENTS. CONTINUUM MECHANICS IS THE MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS US TO DESCRIBE SUCH FLOWS AND HENCE PREDICT AND DESIGN THEM. IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS, SUCH AS THE CELL CYTOSKELETON, FLOW PHENOMENA ARE GENERATED BY INTERNAL DRIVING, POWERED BY PROTEINS AND OTHER BIOCHEMICAL MACHINES THAT CONSUME CHEMICAL ENERGY. CONTINUUM MECHANICAL DESCRIPTIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND APPLIED TO SUCH INTERNALLY DRIVEN BIOLOGICAL FLUIDS IN RECENT YEARS WITH GREAT SUCCESS. SO FAR, EFFORTS HAVE CENTERED AROUND SINGLE-COMPONENT DESCRIPTIONS OF THESE SYSTEMS. IN ACTUALITY, THESE ARE MULTICOMPONENT SYSTEMS. DEVELOPING MULTICOMPONENT CONTINUUM THEORIES FOR INTERNALLY DRIVEN FLUIDS REQUIRES OVERCOMING SEVERAL TECHNICAL CHALLENGES. THIS PROJECT USES MULTI-SCALE THEORY COUPLED WITH DATA DRIVEN TECHNIQUES TO ADDRESS THESE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES AND HENCE DEVELOP MODELS FOR MULTI-COMPONENT BIOLOGICAL FLUIDS. THIS PROJECT IS A STEP TOWARD UNDERSTANDING PHYSICAL MECHANISMS THAT LEAD TO FUNCTION IN NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. FROM A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE, DESIGNING AND CONTROLLING INTERNALLY DRIVEN FLUIDS IS KEY TO ENGINEERING RAPIDLY RECONFIGURABLE LIFE-LIKE MATERIALS, WITH APPLICATIONS IN FIELDS AS DIVERSE AS ROBOTICS, MICROFLUIDICS, AND ADAPTIVE OPTICS. IN ADDITION TO THE SCIENCE OUTCOMES, THE RESEARCH IS INTEGRATED WITH EDUCATION AND OUTREACH INITIATIVES INCLUDING : (I) CONTENT FOR AN ADVANCED UNDERGRADUATE COURSE ON SOFT MATERIALS THEORY ?

TECHNICAL SUMMARY THIS AWARD SUPPORTS THEORETICAL, COMPUTATIONAL, AND DATA-INTENSIVE RESEARCH TO DEVELOP A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR BUILDING PREDICTIVE CONTINUUM DESCRIPTIONS OF COMPOSITE ACTIVE FLUIDS. ACTIVE FLUIDS ARE COMPOSED OF MICROSCOPIC ENTITIES THAT CONSUME ENERGY AND EXERT FORCES. THIS PARADIGM INCLUDES DIVERSE SYSTEMS FROM BACTERIAL SUSPENSIONS TO CYTOSKELETAL FILAMENTS PROPELLED BY MOLECULAR MOTORS AND SYNTHETIC DIFFUSOPHORETIC COLLOIDS. CONTINUUM DESCRIPTIONS OF THE DYNAMICS OF THESE FLUIDS HAVE BEEN POWERFUL IN IDENTIFYING TRANSFERABLE CONCEPTS THAT ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND, CONTROL, AND EVEN PREDICTIVELY DESIGN ACTIVE FLUIDS. RESEARCH TO DATE HAS FOCUSED ON SINGLE COMPONENT FLUID DYNAMIC DESCRIPTIONS OF ACTIVE MATERIALS. BUT EXPERIMENTAL PHENOMENOLOGY CLEARLY SHOWS THE NEED FOR MULTI-COMPONENT DESCRIPTIONS THAT ALLOW FOR DENSITY GRADIENTS IN DIFFERENT COMPONENTS. BUILDING MACROSCOPIC THEORIES OF MULTI-COMPONENT SYSTEMS IS CHALLENGING EVEN IN THE CONTEXT OF TRADITIONAL EQUILIBRATING FLUIDS. ONE NEEDS TO INVOKE CONSIDERATIONS OF RECIPROCITY AND ENTROPY PRODUCTION TO DETERMINE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIFFERENT FLUXES IN THE DYNAMICS OF CONSERVED QUANTITIES. ACTIVE FLUIDS, BEING INHERENTLY OUT OF EQUILIBRIUM ARE LIBERATED FROM THESE CONSTRAINTS. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES THESE CHALLENGES BY DEVELOPING A MULTI-PRONGED APPROACH THAT INTEGRATES DATA DRIVEN MODEL DEVELOPMENT WITH THE STANDARD TECHNIQUES OF SOFT MATERIALS PHYSICS. ON THE ONE HAND, PHENOMENOLOGICAL CONTINUUM MECHANICS WILL BE COMBINED WITH SYSTEMATIC NONEQUILIBRIUM STATISTICAL MECHANICS TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE MECHANISMS AT PLAY IN DETERMINING THE EMERGENT BEHAVIOR IN COMPOSITE ACTIVE FLUIDS. ON THE OTHER HAND, A COMPLEMENTARY DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH IS DEVELOPED, THAT LEVERAGES EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM IN-VITRO CYTOSKELETAL SUSPENSION EXPERIMENTS TO GUIDE MODEL DISCOVERY. THIS PROJECT IS AIMED TO YIELD FUNDAMENTAL THEORETICAL INSIGHTS INTO NON-RECIPROCAL CROSS DIFFUSION PROCESSES AND THEIR ROLE IN EMERGENT BEHAVIOR IN ACTIVE COMPOSITE FLUIDS. THIS EFFORT IS A FIRST STEP IN UNDERSTANDING PHYSICAL MECHANISMS THAT LEAD TO FUNCTION IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. FROM A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE, DESIGNING AND CONTROLLING ACTIVE STRESSES IS KEY TO ENGINEERING RAPIDLY RECONFIGURABLE LIFE-LIKE MATERIALS, WITH APPLICATIONS IN FIELDS AS DIVERSE AS ROBOTICS, MICROFLUIDICS AND ADAPTIVE OPTICS. THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED IN THIS PROJECT WILL ADVANCE OUR ABILITY TO ENGINEER ACTIVE STRESS IN MATERIALS. INTEGRATED WITH THE RESEARCH EFFORT, THIS PROJECT WILL PRODUCE IMPACT IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN PHYSICS EDUCATION THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES: (I) THE DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF CONTENT FOR AN ADVANCED UNDERGRADUATE COURSE ON SOFT MATERIALS THEORY ?

(II) OUTREACH INITIATIVES IN THE WALTHAM COMMUNITY AND BEYOND ?

WHILE MANY BRAIN REGIONS INTERACT TO ENABLE COGNITIVE PROCESSES OF LEARNING AND DECISION MAKING, THE SUBICULUM AND HIPPOCAMPUS OF THE MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE ARE CENTRAL NODES IN THE UNDERLYING NEURAL CIRCUIT. ACCORDINGLY, MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE DYSFUNCTION IS A HALLMARK OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS SUCH AS DEPRESSION, PTSD AND OTHER ANXIETY DISORDERS, EPILEPSY, AND ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE. UNDERSTANDING BASIC NEURAL FUNCTION AND COORDINATION PROCESSES IN THE SUBICULUM AND HIPPOCAMPUS DURING MEMORY AND DECISION MAKING WILL THEREFORE BE CRUCIAL IN THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR THESE DISORDERS; HOWEVER, SUBICULUM FUNCTION AND ITS COORDINATION WITH HIPPOCAMPUS DURING THESE COGNITIVE TASKS IS ALMOST COMPLETELY UNKNOWN. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT SUBICULUM LINKS INDIVIDUAL MEMORIES FORMED BY THE HIPPOCAMPUS AND THEREBY ENABLES COGNITIVE CAPABILITIES SUCH AS ABSTRACTION, CATEGORIZATION, AND DELIBERATION DURING DECISION MAKING. DURING THE MENTORED PHASE (K99), HIGH-DENSITY IN VIVO ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY WILL BE USED IN RATS TO OBSERVE SUBICULUM AND HIPPOCAMPAL SUBREGION CA1 ACTIVITY DURING A NAVIGATIONAL MEMORY-GUIDED DECISION MAKING TASK. OPTOGENETIC INTERRUPTION OF THE PROPOSED COORDINATION MECHANISM BETWEEN SUBICULUM AND CA1 DURING BEHAVIOR WILL THEN PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO ITS NECESSITY FOR MEMORY-GUIDED DECISION MAKING. THEORETICAL MODELS WILL ASSESS PLAUSIBLE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE FORMATION OF SUBICULUM ACTIVITY PATTERNS. EXPERIMENTS DURING THE INDEPENDENT (R00) PHASE WILL EXTEND THIS APPROACH THROUGH THE DORSAL-VENTRAL EXTENT OF CA1 AND SUBICULUM AND TO EMOTIONAL ASPECTS OF MEMORY SUCH AS HEDONIC VALUE. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THIS PROPOSAL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RESULT IN TWO SIGNIFICANT CONCEPTUAL BREAKTHROUGHS: 1) SUBICULUM IS A MAJOR AND CRITICAL COMPONENT OF HIPPOCAMPAL OUTPUT WITH SPECIFIC AND DISTINCT FUNCTIONS DURING MEMORY-GUIDED DECISION MAKING, 2) SUBICULUM AND CA1 FUNCTION AND ENCODING PROPERTIES ARE CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THEIR DORSAL-VENTRAL EXTENTS AND ARE BEST UNDERSTOOD UNDER A SINGLE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK.

CURRENTLY, SUCH TRANSLATION IS DONE ON A TASK-BY-TASK AND LANGUAGE-BY-LANGUAGE BASIS. SUCH A FRAGMENTED APPROACH INTRODUCES REDUNDANCY AND REPETITION, AND IS THUS INEFFICIENT. UNIFORM MEANING REPRESENTATION (UMR) IS DESIGNED AS A MACHINE-READABLE LANGUAGE THAT ALL LANGUAGES, FROM HIGH-RESOURCE LANGUAGES SUCH AS ENGLISH AND CHINESE, TO LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGES LIKE ARAPAHO, CAN BE TRANSLATED INTO. UMR CAN ALSO BE EXTENDED TO MULTI-MODAL SETTINGS TO REPRESENT THE CONTENT OF VIDEOS AND IMAGES, ALLOWING COMPUTERS TO BETTER PROCESS AND UNDERSTAND THE CONTENT OF THESE MEDIA FORMS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO BUILD THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR TRANSLATING LANGUAGES AND OTHER MEDIA INTO UMRS. THIS INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDES TOOLS USED TO FACILITATE THE TRANSLATION OF HUMAN LANGUAGE TO UMRS, METRICS THAT CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF UMRS, AND AN INITIAL COLLECTION OF UMRS FOR FIVE LANGUAGES THAT HAVE VERY DIFFERENT LINGUISTIC PROPERTIES: ENGLISH, CHINESE, ARABIC, ARAPAHO, AND QUECHUA, AS WELL AS VIDEO CONTENT THAT INCLUDES BOTH LANGUAGE AND GESTURES FOR TWO OF THOSE LANGUAGES.. THE PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES OUTREACH EFFORTS TO ENGAGE FELLOW RESEARCHERS TO PRODUCE UMRS FOR ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES AND GENRES WITH TUTORIALS, WORKSHOPS, SUMMER SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS ONLINE TRAINING MATERIALS. ONCE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF UMRS ARE CREATED FOR A LANGUAGE, COMPUTER MODELS AND ALGORITHMS CAN BE TRAINED ON THESE UMRS TO AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCE MORE UMRS FOR NEW DATA IN THAT LANGUAGE. THEY CAN THEN BE USED TO ADVANCE THE STATE OF THE ART FOR A WIDE RANGE OF DOWNSTREAM HUMAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES, RANGING FROM HUMAN ROBOT INTERACTION TO DIALOGUE SYSTEMS, FROM INFORMATION EXTRACTION TO QUESTION ANSWERING, FROM MACHINE TRANSLATION TO TEXT SUMMARIZATION. THE PROJECT WILL ALSO PRODUCE UMRS FOR UNDER-RESOURCED LANGUAGES AND HELP BRING MODERN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES TO SPEAKERS OF THOSE LANGUAGES, AS WELL AS PEOPLE WORKING ON THE DOCUMENTATION AND/OR REVITALIZATION OF THE LANGUAGES. THIS PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF LINGUISTS AND COMPUTER SCIENTISTS TO JOINTLY BUILD AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR UNIFORM MEANING REPRESENTATION (UMR), A PRACTICAL, FORMAL, COMPUTATIONALLY TRACTABLE, AND CROSS-LINGUISTICALLY VALID DOCUMENT-LEVEL MEANING REPRESENTATION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE THAT CAN IMPACT A WIDE RANGE OF DOWNSTREAM APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE ?DEEP? NATURAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING (NLU). THE UMR INFRASTRUCTURE WILL CONSIST OF UMR-ANNOTATED DATA SETS FOR FIVE LANGUAGES, INCLUDING MULTIMODAL DATA SETS FOR TWO OF THOSE LANGUAGES, ENGLISH AND ARAPAHO, A UMR ANNOTATION INTERFACE AND RELEVANT TRAINING MATERIALS, BASELINE UMR PARSING MODELS THAT FELLOW NLP RESEARCHERS CAN USE AS A POINT OF COMPARISON WHEN DEVELOPING MORE ADVANCED UMR PARSING MODELS, METRICS FOR EVALUATING DOCUMENT-LEVEL MEANING REPRESENTATIONS, AND A PLATFORM FOR DISSEMINATING THE UMR DATA SETS, TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO USERS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES A BROAD RANGE OF OUTREACH EFFORTS CONSISTING OF WORKSHOPS, TUTORIALS, SUMMER SCHOOLS, AND A SHARED TASK AT THE END OF THE PROJECT TO INVOLVE FELLOW RESEARCHERS IN THE NLP COMMUNITY TO PRODUCE UMRS FOR ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES AND PROMOTE THE USE OF THE UMR INFRASTRUCTURE IN MEANING REPRESENTATION PARSING RESEARCH AND DOWNSTREAM APPLICATIONS. THE UMR INFRASTRUCTURE PROMOTES THE DEVELOPMENT OF GENERAL PURPOSE MULTILINGUAL AND MULTIMODAL APPLICATIONS IN AN EFFORT TO MOVE AWAY FROM BOTH LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC AND TASK-SPECIFIC MODELS THAT REQUIRE REPETITIVE AND OFTEN CONFLICTING SEMANTIC ANNOTATION EFFORTS.

POMBE, THE NUCLEUS BEHAVES AS AN ?IDEAL OSMOMETER? WHOSE SIZE CORRESPONDS QUANTITATIVELY TO ITS OSMOTIC ENVIRONMENT. THIS MODEL WILL BE TESTED IN EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH PHYSICAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS OSMOTIC PRESSURE ARE VARIED. THE MECHANISM OF NUCLEAR SIZE HOMEOSTASIS IN WHICH ABNORMAL NUCLEAR SIZES ARE GRADUALLY CORRECTED WILL BE ELUCIDATED. MECHANISMS THAT COUPLE NUCLEAR VOLUME GROWTH AND NUCLEAR ENVELOPE SURFACE AREA WILL BE EXAMINED. THIS OSMOTIC MODEL OF NUCLEAR SIZE PROMISES TO GREATLY IMPACT THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF ORGANELLE SIZE REGULATION.

THE STUDY OF CRYSTALLIZATION HAS LED TO FUNDAMENTAL DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF MATTER, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW WATER FREEZES TO BECOME ICE. CRYSTALLIZATION IS ALSO CENTRAL TO A WIDE VARIETY OF IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES, RANGING FROM MICROELECTRONICS TO PHARMACEUTICALS. YET, DESPITE THE UBIQUITY OF CRYSTALLIZATION IN BOTH FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED SCIENCE, MANY MYSTERIES REGARDING THE DYNAMICS OF CRYSTALLIZATION REMAIN. THE SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMIC PATHWAYS BY WHICH CRYSTALS FORM AND TO USE THAT UNDERSTANDING TO DEVELOP NEW METHODS FOR MAKING MACROSCOPIC SINGLE CRYSTALS WITH EXOTIC MATERIALS PROPERTIES. THE RESEARCH WILL REVEAL NEW FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PHYSICS OF CRYSTALLIZATION AND LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR PROGRAMMABLE NANOMATERIALS OF THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD FIND APPLICATIONS IN OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS, LIGHT-HARVESTING, AND OTHER NEXT-GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES. THE RESEARCH PROJECT ALSO TRAINS STUDENTS IN THE INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELD OF SOFT CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS AND ENGAGES THE PUBLIC IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SCIENCE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE RESEARCH TEAM IS DEVELOPING STUDENT-LED, STUDENT-FOCUSED SUMMER PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH PRACTICAL HANDS-ON TRAINING IN THE LABORATORY, WHILE ALSO PROMOTING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION BY CREATING A COMMUNITY OF RESEARCHERS AND REINFORCING GROUP COHESION. THE TEAM IS ALSO CREATING OUTREACH ACTIVITIES WITH A LOCAL SCIENCE MUSEUM FOCUSED ON ENHANCING INTEREST AND SCIENTIFIC LITERACY IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. TECHNICAL ABSTRACT THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTAL THERMODYNAMIC AND KINETIC DRIVING FORCES THAT GOVERN THE DYNAMIC PATHWAYS TO CRYSTALLIZATION, AND TO DEVELOP PRACTICAL STRATEGIES FOR CONTROLLING THOSE PATHWAYS TO CREATE NEW OPTICAL METAMATERIALS FROM DNA-COATED COLLOIDS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS ORGANIZED AROUND TWO SPECIFIC STUDIES. IN THE FIRST STUDY, THE RESEARCH TEAM IS EXPLORING HOW THE KINETICS OF NUCLEATION AND GROWTH EMERGE FROM THE PAIR-INTERACTION POTENTIAL, AS WELL AS THE DETAILS OF THE PARENT FLUID PHASE AND THE CHILD CRYSTAL PHASE. THE RESEARCH TEAM USES AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH COMBINING DROPLET-BASED MICROFLUIDICS WITH OPTICAL MICROSCOPY TO SYSTEMATICALLY QUANTIFY THE FULL DYNAMIC EVOLUTION OF HUNDREDS OF EXPERIMENTS RUNNING IN PARALLEL. THEY ARE ALSO DEVELOPING A SUITE OF THEORETICAL TOOLS BASED ON THE STATISTICAL MECHANICS OF MULTIVALENT INTERACTIONS, CLASSICAL NUCLEATION THEORY, AND CLASSICAL THEORIES OF CRYSTAL GROWTH TO UNCOVER MICROSCOPIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRYSTALLIZATION PATHWAYS AND TO CREATE A DATA-DRIVEN FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE THE DESIGN OF THEIR EXPERIMENTS. IN THE SECOND STUDY, THE RESEARCH TEAM IS UTILIZING THEIR FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF NUCLEATION AND GROWTH TO CREATE RATIONAL NONEQUILIBRIUM PROTOCOLS FOR FORMING SINGLE CRYSTALS WITH PRESCRIBED STRUCTURES, WHICH COULD BE USED IN FUTURE APPLICATIONS IN PHOTONICS AND PLASMONICS. HERE THEY DRAW INSPIRATION FROM TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIAL PRACTICES, SUCH AS SLOW TEMPERATURE RAMPS, TEMPERATURE CYCLING, MULTISTEP NUCLEATION AND GROWTH PROTOCOLS, AND SEEDED NUCLEATION. WHILE EXISTING STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON EXPANDING THE DIVERSITY OF STATIC STRUCTURES THAT FORM IN EQUILIBRIUM, THE RESEARCH TEAM IS WORKING TO UNDERSTAND THE RICH DYNAMICAL PATHWAYS BY WHICH THOSE STRUCTURES SELF-ASSEMBLE AND TO DEVELOP NEW APPROACHES TO CONTROL THOSE PATHWAYS IN ORDER TO ASSEMBLE MACROSCOPIC PROGRAMMABLE MATERIALS FROM COLLOIDS.

THE LC IS STRUCTURALLY CONNECTED TO THE TEMPORAL LOBE AND MAY PLAY A ROLE IN TRANSMITTING ABNORMAL TAU THROUGH TRANS-NEURONAL SPREAD. THE LC IS THE PRIMARY PRODUCER OF THE NEUROMODULATOR NOREPINEPHRINE. NOREPINEPHRINE IS ESSENTIAL FOR NORMAL ATTENTION AND MEMORY FUNCTION. BEYOND A ROLE IN COGNITION, NOREPINEPHRINE SERVES A MYRIAD OF NEUROPROTECTIVE ROLES WHICH INCLUDE INHIBITION OF OXIDATIVE STRESS, MAINTENANCE OF THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER, AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROCESSES. THE OCCURRENCE OF HYPERPHOSPHORYLATED TAU IN THE LC HAS BEEN LINKED WITH LOSS OF NOREPINEPHRINE-PRODUCING LC NEURONS. THE TARGETING AND NEURODEGENERATION OF LC IS PARTICULARLY INSIDIOUS DUE TO THE COMBINED LOSS OF COGNITION-ENHANCING NEUROMODULATION AND LOSS OF NEUROPROTECTIVE FUNCTIONS THUS PAVING THE WAY FOR DISEASE ACCELERATION AND PROPAGATION. DESPITE INSULTS TO THE LC, THERE IS EVIDENCE FOR UPREGULATION OF NOREPINEPHRINE METABOLISM IN HEALTHY AGING, MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, AND AD. WE PROPOSE UPREGULATION OF NOREPINEPHRINE SYNTHESIS IN THE LC CELLS REMAINING REPRESENTS A MECHANISM OF NEUROCHEMICAL COMPENSATION THAT, IN SOME INDIVIDUALS, WARDS OFF COGNITIVE DECLINE AND PROTECTS AGAINST DISEASE SPREAD. IN HEALTHY OLDER ADULT HUMANS, WE WILL DEFINE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LC STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY, AND NOREPINEPHRINE SYNTHESIS LEVELS (AIM 1). WE WILL DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH ELEVATED NOREPINEPHRINE SYNTHESIS CONFERS A BENEFIT TO MEMORY PERFORMANCE (AIM 2). FINALLY, WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ELEVATED NOREPINEPHRINE SYNTHESIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED TAU ACCUMULATION LONGITUDINALLY (AIM 3).

ADVANCED MATERIALS ARE ESSENTIAL TO NEARLY EVERY ASPECT OF MODERN LIFE, INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HEALTH, NATIONAL DEFENSE, AND MANY OTHERS. COMBINING TWO DISPARATE MATERIALS, SUCH AS RELATIVELY SOFT POLYMERS (E.G., PLASTICS) AND HARD SOLIDS (E.G., CERAMICS, CLAYS, ETC.), CAN BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR MAKING NEW COMPOSITES COMBINING THE BEST PROPERTIES OF BOTH MATERIALS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THEIR DIFFERENT CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS, THOROUGHLY COMBINING SUCH MATERIALS IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. IN THIS EFFORT, A SERIES OF HIGHLY ADVANCED EXPERIMENTAL AND SIMULATION TECHNIQUES ARE USED TO ELUCIDATE THE INTERACTIONS OF POLYMERS WITH A CLASS OF SOLIDS KNOWN AS METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS (MOFS). INSIGHTS INTO THE INTERFACE AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN POLYMERS AND MOFS WILL ENABLE THEIR MORE EFFECTIVE COMBINATION FOR MAKING HYBRID MATERIALS WITH INTRIGUING AND UNPRECEDENTED PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION TO THESE STUDIES, THIS PROGRAM SUPPORTS UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM TO TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON, DC, WHERE THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN INTERNSHIPS AT THE INTERFACE OF PUBLIC POLICY AND SCIENCE THROUGH THE SCIENCE POLICY INTERNSHIP PROGRAM (SPIP). TECHNICAL ABSTRACT COMBINING ORGANIC POLYMERS AND METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS (MOFS) HAS PROVEN AN IMPORTANT AREA OF RESEARCH FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYBRID, COMPOSITE MATERIALS THAT POSSESS FAVORABLE PROPERTIES OF BOTH COMPONENTS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THESE TWO DISPARATE MATERIALS INTERACT AT THE MOLECULAR SCALE. THIS EFFORT EXPLORES THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SOFT, ORGANIC POLYMERS AND HARD, INORGANIC MOFS USING A COMBINATION OF SYNTHESIS, SPECTROSCOPY, ADVANCED IMAGING, AND SIMULATIONS. STATE-OF-THE-ART SOLID-STATE NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (NMR) TECHNIQUES, COUPLED WITH SCANNING- AND TRANSMISSION-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (SEM, TEM) AS WELL AS ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL METHODS, ARE USED TO EXAMINE THE INTERACTIONS OF POLYMERS WITH MOFS IN THREE TYPES OF COMPOSITES: MIXED-MATRIX MEMBRANES (MMMS), MOF BRUSH POLYMERS, AND POLYMER-DERIVED MOFS (A.K.A. POLYMOFS). ULTIMATELY, THE FINDINGS FROM THESE STUDIES WILL BE AMONG THE MOST DETAILED INVESTIGATIONS OF MOF?POLYMER INTERFACES AND WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO GUIDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE HYBRID MATERIALS TOWARD TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS.

OF PARTICULAR INTEREST AS A POSSIBLE FUNCTIONAL PARTNER TO GC IS THE LATERAL HYPOTHALAMUS (LH), WHICH HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN TO BE CENTRALLY INVOLVED IN FEEDING BEHAVIOR, AND WHICH CONTAINS NEURONS PRODUCING TWO DISTINCT TYPES OF PALATABILITY-RELATED TASTE RESPONSES. THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBES WORK THAT WILL USE MULTI-ELECTRODE ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY, ELECTROMYOGRAPHY, PATHWAY- AND NEURON-SPECIFIC OPTOGENETICS, AND COMPLEX NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL ANALYSES TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER AND HOW GC AND LH COORDINATE TO DRIVE CONSUMPTION-RELATED CORTICAL FIRING AND BEHAVIOR.

PROFESSOR XU IS DEVELOPING NEW, MORE SUSTAINABLE METHODS FOR CONVERTING READILY AVAILABLE HYDROCARBONS INTO MORE VALUABLE MOLECULES THAT CONTAIN ONE OR MORE NITROGEN ATOMS. A LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL-MOLECULE PHARMACEUTICALS AND FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS CONTAIN NITROGEN ATOMS, A SITUATION THAT MAKES THE CHEMISTRY BEING DEVELOPED BOTH TIMELY AND IMPORTANT FOR ADDRESSING MODERN SYNTHETIC NEEDS. THE CHEMISTRY IS ALSO MORE SUSTAINABLE THAT THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS BECAUSE THE REAGENTS USED BY PROFESSOR XU AND HIS STUDENTS ARE DERIVED FROM IRON - THE SECOND MOST ABUNDANT METAL IN THE EARTH'S CRUST - AND STABLE, COMMON PEROXIDES. THESE SIMPLE REAGENTS REPLACE THE MUCH MORE RARE AND EXPENSIVE REAGENTS TYPICALLY USED FOR THE CURRENT METHODS. THE RESEARCH PROGRAM LIES AT THE INTERFACE OF ORGANIC, INORGANIC, AND MECHANISTIC CHEMISTRY; THEREFORE, IT PROVIDES A UNIQUE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL LEVELS OF YOUNG SCIENTISTS. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF MINORITY STUDENTS WHO ATTEND GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND PROFESSOR XU'S STRONG COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH THOSE STUDENTS. THIS RESEARCH PROGRAM AIMS TO DEVELOP AND STUDY NOVEL SYNTHETIC APPROACHES THAT HARNESS STABLE PEROXIDES TO SELECTIVELY FUNCTIONALIZE A BROAD RANGE OF OLEFINS WITH NON-OXYGEN-BASED GROUPS. IN THE FIRST PHASE OF THIS PROJECT, PROFESSOR XU AND HIS STUDENTS ARE EXPLORING THE REACTIVITY OF UNIQUE IRON COMPLEXES WITH STABLE PEROXIDES AND DEVELOPING AN IRON-CATALYZED METHOD FOR SELECTIVE OLEFIN DIAZIDATION/DIAMINATION REACTIONS. THE WORK IS EXPANDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF IRON-CATALYZED PROCESS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF OLEFINS AND N-HETEROCYCLES. IN THE SECOND PHASE OF THIS PROJECT, THE GROUP IS EXPLORING NEW IRON-CATALYZED ACTIVATION APPROACHES FOR FLUOROALKYL TRANSFER REACTIONS. THE WORK IS PROVIDING A GENERAL AND SELECTIVE APPROACH FOR OLEFIN FUNCTIONALIZATION THAT WILL LIKELY BECOME A USEFUL TOOL FOR ORGANIC CHEMISTS. IN TERMS OF BROADER IMPACT, THIS PROJECT IS INTEGRATING THE EFFORT TO DEVELOP MORE SUSTAINABLE METHODS FOR CONSTRUCTING VALUE ADDED MOLECULES WITH EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT INCLUDE I) TRANSFORMING TEACHING WITH UNDERGRADUATE MENTORING AND RESEARCH AND (II) PROVIDING SUMMER RESEARCH EXPERIENCES FOR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND VISITING STUDENTS.

NEURONAL EVS MEDIATE ACTIVITY- DEPENDENT SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY, AS WELL AS THE SPREAD AND CLEARANCE OF TOXIC PROTEIN AGGREGATES ASSOCIATED WITH NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS SUCH AS ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE AND PARKINSON’S DISEASE. EV BIOGENESIS AND SECRETION OCCURS VIA ENDOSOMAL TRAFFICKING, BUT THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH NEURONAL ACTIVITY REGULATES THESE CELL BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES HAVE NOT BEEN WELL CHARACTERIZED.

IN THE SECOND AIM, I WILL ELUCIDATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAMKII AND SYT4 AND TEST IF THEY ACT IN A SHARED PATHWAY TO PROMOTE STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL PLASTICITY. IN AIM 3, I WILL ISOLATE THE SPECIFIC CAMKII FUNCTION(S) INVOLVED IN EV CARGO AND TRAFFICKING REGULATION. THESE AIMS WILL PROVIDE TRAINING IN ADVANCED IMAGING, QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS, DROSOPHILA GENETICS, AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY.

SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL MAPPING OF ITS SITE OF ACTION DEMONSTRATES THAT IT IS REQUIRED DURING PUPATION IN A POPULATION OF CELLS THAT TRANSCRIBES BOTH CHOLINERGIC AND GLUTAMATERGIC GENES BUT DIFFERENTIATES TO BECOME A SMALL SUBSET OF THE ADULT GLUTAMATERGIC NEURONS.

DESPITE THE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES, FEWER THAN 10% OF THOSE WITH ALCOHOL USE DISORDER (AUD) RECEIVE EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT, AND RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES AND WOMEN ARE LESS LIKELY TO ACCESS TREATMENT. BARRIERS TO TREATMENT INCLUDE STIGMA, TREATMENT SETTING APPEAL, AND HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFIT DESIGN. MEDICAID PROGRAMS ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT PAYERS FOR AUD TREATMENT AND RATES OF AUD IN THE MEDICAID POPULATION ARE ESPECIALLY HIGH. MEDICAID PROVIDES HEALTH INSURANCE FOR MORE THAN 77 MILLION AMERICANS, INCLUDING A LARGE AND DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES, WOMEN, AND RURAL AMERICANS. ALMOST ALL STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS CONTRACT WITH MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS (MMCOS) TO DELIVER AND MANAGE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND NEARLY 70% OF MEDICAID ENROLLEES ARE NOW IN MANAGED CARE.

HOWEVER, THERE IS ALMOST NO INFORMATION OR TRANSPARENCY ON MMCO POLICES RELATED TO ALCOHOL TREATMENT SERVICES. THIS STUDY SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINES AUD TREATMENT POLICIES IN MMCOS, AN UNDER-EXPLORED LEVEL WHERE IMPORTANT DECISIONS ARE MADE THAT INFLUENCE ACCESS AND OUTCOMES. WE WILL CONDUCT A NATIONAL SURVEY OF MMCOS AND LINK THEIR RESPONSES TO PATIENT-LEVEL MEDICAID DATA. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: 1) EXAMINE MEDICAID MMCO ALCOHOL TREATMENT POLICIES (E.G. COVERAGE, UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT, PROVIDER NETWORKS, INNOVATIONS) ACROSS MMCOS THAT CONTRACT WITH THE 50 STATES AND DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA; DETERMINE WHETHER THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN MMCO ALCOHOL TREATMENT POLICIES BY STATE MEDICAID POLICIES. 2) ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MMCO POLICIES AND ACCESS TO AUD TREATMENT (E.G. INITIATION AND ENGAGEMENT IN TREATMENT, FOLLOW-UP AFTER HOSPITALIZATION) BY RACE/ETHNICITY, GENDER, AND RURAL/URBAN GEOGRAPHY. 3) ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MMCO POLICIES AND ALCOHOL TREATMENT OUTCOMES (I.E..

OUR INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED WITH EXPERIENCE CONDUCTING FOUR PREVIOUS COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLAN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STUDIES, AND CONDUCTING RIGOROUS DISPARITIES AND MEDICAID ANALYSES.

EXOSOMES ARE SMALL EXTRACELLULAR MEMBRANE-BOUND VESICLES THAT CARRY PROTEINS, LIPIDS, DNA AND/OR RNA FROM DONOR CELL TO RECIPIENT CELL FOR DISPOSAL OR INTERCELLULAR COMMUNICATION. IN NEURONS, EXOSOMES CAN FACILITATE BOTH THE CLEARANCE AND SPREAD OF TOXIC PROTEINS IN NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. EXOSOMES ARE FORMED BY INVAGINATION OF THE ENDOSOMAL MEMBRANE TO CREATE A MULTIVESICULAR BODY (MVB) WHICH THEN FUSES TO THE PLASMA MEMBRANE, RELEASING ITS INTRALUMENAL VESICLES (ILVS) INTO THE EXTRACELLULAR SPACE. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EXOSOME FORMATION AND RELEASE COMES LARGELY FROM WORK DONE IN IN VITRO NON-NEURONAL CELL SYSTEMS, AND WHILE MANY OF THE MOLECULES AND PATHWAYS INVOLVED WERE IDENTIFIED IN THESE SYSTEMS, EXPLORING NEURONAL EXOSOME AND ENDOSOME BIOLOGY IN AN ANIMAL WILL BE CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING NEURON-SPECIFIC AND PHYSIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN EXOSOME FORMATION AND RELEASE. IN PARTICULAR, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHEN AND WHERE MVBS ARE GENERATED IN NEURONS, AND HOW EXOSOME-DIRECTED MVBS ARE PROTECTED FROM CONVENTIONAL LYSOSOMAL DEGRADATION. THE DROSOPHILA NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION (NMJ) IS AN EXCELLENT SYSTEM TO STUDY EXOSOME BIOLOGY IN VIVO, AND OUR LAB HAS DEVELOPED TOOLS TO TRACK ENDOGENOUSLY LABELED EXOSOME CARGOES. THESE TOOLS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH EASY GENETIC MANIPULATION AND IMAGEABILITY OF THE DROSOPHILA NMJ, MAKES IT A GREAT SYSTEM TO STUDY EXOSOME FORMATION AND RELEASE. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO PATHWAYS (ESCRT AND MUNC13- 4/RAB11) WHICH WE WILL MANIPULATE TO INVESTIGATE ENDOSOMAL DYNAMICS SURROUNDING THE FORMATION OF THE MVB AND EXOSOME RELEASE. THE ESCRT (ENDOSOMAL SORTING COMPLEXES REQUIRED FOR TRANSPORT) PATHWAY IS INVOLVED IN FORMATION OF THE ILVS FROM WHICH EXOSOMES ARISE. I HAVE SHOWN THAT LOSS OF TSG101, AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE ESCRT PATHWAY, LEADS TO A LOSS OF EXOSOME RELEASE AND AN INCREASE IN PRESYNAPTIC CARGO LEVELS. BY TRACKING AND MANIPULATING TSG101, I WILL DETERMINE THE SUBCELLULAR DISTRIBUTION AND DYNAMICS OF EXOSOMAL MVBS AND TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT FORMATION OF ILVS/MVBS IS TEMPORALLY AND INTRINSICALLY LINKED TO CARGO DISTRIBUTION, ENDOSOME MATURATION STATE, AND EXOSOME CARGO FUNCTION (AIM 1). PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN A REQUIREMENT FOR MUNC13-4 IN EXOSOME RELEASE, WHICH REQUIRES THE RECYCLING ENDOSOME (RE) PROTEIN, RAB11. IN COMBINATION WITH OUR WORK SHOWING THAT LOSS OF RAB11 LEADS TO DECREASED EXOSOME CARGO LEVELS, WE WILL USE THIS PATHWAY AS A TOOL TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INTERACTION BETWEEN RES AND MVBS PROMOTES RELEASE OF EXOSOMES AT THE PLASMA MEMBRANE (AIM 2). THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL I WILL EXPAND MY SKILLSETS IN MICROSCOPY, INCLUDING HIGH-RESOLUTION AND ELECTRON MICROSCOPY, AS WELL AS QUANTITATIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS AND DROSOPHILA GENETICS.

THE LC IS THE BRAIN’S PRIMARY GENERATOR OF THE NEUROMODULATOR NOREPINEPHRINE (NE) AND IS ONE OF THE FIRST BRAIN REGIONS TO ACCUMULATE HYPERPHOSPHORYLATED TAU PROTEIN, A HALLMARK PATHOLOGICAL AGENT IN AD. THE ABILITY TO USE MAGNETIC RESONANCE (MR) IMAGING TO ASSESS LC INTEGRITY OPENS UP EXCITING POSSIBILITIES FOR EARLIEST DETECTION OF DISEASE ACCELERATION, AND MAY ALSO PROVIDE AN MR MEASURE THAT CAPTURES INFORMATION ABOUT INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN NEUROCHEMICAL FUNCTION. THE ABILITY TO STUDY NEUROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS IN VIVO IN HUMANS IS LIMITED, WITH IMAGING APPROACHES USING RADIOACTIVE TRACERS BEING THE MOST ESTABLISHED (E.G. POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET)). HOWEVER, DUE TO THE BURDEN TO SUBJECTS, AS WELL AS THE INFRASTRUCTURAL CHALLENGES, PET IMAGING IS NOT A TOOL MANY RESEARCHERS USE DESPITE THE CENTRAL ROLE NEUROMODULATORY SYSTEMS LIKE NE PLAY IN BASIC COGNITION AND DISEASE. WE WILL TAKE INITIAL STEPS TOWARDS TESTING THE VALIDITY OF LC MR MEASURES FOR PREDICTING NE FUNCTION BY EXAMINING THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN A NEUROMELANIN-SENSITIVE MR MEASURE OF LC INTEGRITY AND A PET MEASURE OF CATECHOLAMINE (NOREPINEPHRINE/DOPAMINE) SYNTHESIS CAPACITY ([18F]FLUORO-L-M-TYROSINE (FMT)) WITHIN SUBJECT IN HEALTHY YOUNG AND OLDER ADULTS (AIM 1). ACCUMULATING EVIDENCE IN HEALTHY AGING, AD, AND PARKINSON’S DISEASE SUGGESTS THE CATECHOLAMINE SYSTEM RESPONDS TO INJURY AND SHOWS COMPENSATORY CAPACITY. NEXT, WE WILL TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT WITH ADVANCING AGE, CATECHOLAMINE SYNTHESIS GOES UP (AIM 2). FINALLY, TO TEST THE UTILITY OF LC NEUROIMAGING MEASURES AS FORECASTERS OF THE ADVANCEMENT OF TAU PATHOLOGY, WE WILL EXPLORE WHETHER NEUROMELANIN-SENSITIVE MR AND [18F]FMT PREDICT THE ACCUMULATION OF TAU IN THE MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE USING TAU-SENSITIVE [18F]FLORTAUCIPIR IMAGING (AIM 3).

WHILE IT IS CRITICAL THAT UPON CELL-CELL CONTACT, NEW SYNAPSES FORM THE CORRECT POSTSYNAPTIC SPECIALIZATION (EXCITATORY OR INHIBITORY), THE MOLECULAR PATHWAYS SPECIFYING THIS IDENTITY REMAIN A FUNDAMENTAL MYSTERY IN DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROBIOLOGY. THIS PROCESS IS PRESUMABLY REGULATED BY TRANS-SYNAPTIC LIGAND/RECEPTOR PARTNERS THAT BELONG TO PROTEIN FAMILIES (E.G. NEUROLIGINS/NEUREXINS, EPHRINS/EPHS, SEMAPHORINS/PLEXINS) WHICH HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO REGULATE BOTH EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY SYNAPSE FORMATION. SEMAPHORINS (SEMAS) AND PLEXINS ARE FAMILIES OF WIDELY EXPRESSED AND FUNCTIONALLY VERSATILE TRANSMEMBRANE OR SECRETED LIGANDS AND THEIR TRANSMEMBRANE RECEPTORS THAT FIRST GAINED ATTENTION FOR THEIR ROLES IN AXON GUIDANCE DURING NERVOUS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT. CLASS 4 SEMAS AND PLEXIN-B RECEPTORS ARE EXPRESSED IN MAMMALIAN HIPPOCAMPUS (IN EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY NEURONS AND IN GLIA) AND PROMOTE SYNAPSE FORMATION BOTH DURING DEVELOPMENT AND IN ADULTHOOD. OUR PREVIOUS STUDIES REVEALED SEMA4D TO BE ONE OF FEW MOLECULES HAVING SYNAPTOGENIC FUNCTION RESTRICTED TO INHIBITORY SYNAPSES; THE EXTRACELLULAR DOMAIN OF SEMA4D INDUCES INHIBITORY SYNAPSE FORMATION ON A RAPID TIMESCALE (~30 MINS) THROUGH THE PLEXIN-B1 RECEPTOR. ADDITIONALLY, SEMA4A PROMOTES FORMATION OF BOTH INHIBITORY AND EXCITATORY SYNAPSES IN HIPPOCAMPUS VIA THE PLEXIN-B1 OR PLEXIN-B2 RECEPTORS, RESPECTIVELY. THE ABILITY TO RAPIDLY DRIVE SYNAPSE FORMATION BY APPLICATION OF SEMA4A OR SEMA4D, AS WELL AS THE OBSERVATIONS THAT THESE SEMAS REGULATE INHIBITORY AND EXCITATORY SYNAPSE FORMATION IN UNIQUE WAYS REQUIRING DIFFERENT PLEXIN-B RECEPTORS, ARE CENTRAL TO OUR PROPOSED STRATEGY TO IDENTIFY THE DISTINCT SIGNALING CONFORMATIONS THAT INSTRUCT SYNAPSE IDENTITY (EXCITATORY OR INHIBITORY) DOWNSTREAM OF PLEXIN-B RECEPTOR ENGAGEMENT. FURTHER, WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED THAT SEMA4D PROTEIN APPLICATION INCREASES RESILIENCE TO SEIZURE IN ADULT MICE IN VIVO, A FINDING THAT SUPPORTS THE POTENTIAL CLINICAL IMPACT OF THIS WORK. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH USES A COMBINATION OF TRANSGENIC MICE, ORGANOTYPIC HIPPOCAMPAL SLICE CULTURE, GENE KNOCKDOWN, AND EXPRESSION OF MUTANT FORMS OF PLEXIN-B RECEPTORS TO EXAMINE THE DIVERGENT ROLES OF 1) UNIQUE PLEXIN-B SIGNALING DOMAINS, 2) A NOVEL MECHANISM GATING PLEXIN-B1 SIGNALING IN CIS, AND 3) CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PLEXIN-B CORECEPTORS, IN EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY SYNAPSE FORMATION PROMOTED BY CLASS 4 SEMAPHORINS.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,O,PRIVATE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_F31NS118799_7529/,2024-01-19
